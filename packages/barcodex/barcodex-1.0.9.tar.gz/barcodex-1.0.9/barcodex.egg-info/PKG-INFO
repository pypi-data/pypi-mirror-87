        BarcodEx extracts UMIs using either a pattern sequence or a regular expression and appends the concatenated UMIs from each read separated by a "." to the read name preceded by a separator string specified in the command. 
        UMIs can be extracted from read 1 and/or read 2 using respectively ```--pattern1``` and ```--pattern2```. At leat 1 pattern must be used. When extracting UMIs in read 1 and read 2, ```--pattern1``` and ```--pattern2``` must be both either a string sequence or a regular expression.
        Reads that are not matching the provided patterns are discarded. Discarded reads are written to file for inspection. Morover, the extracted sequences are also recovered and written to file.
        ```--prefix``` specifies the start of the output files. (e.g ```--prefix``` x would result in x_R1.fastq.gz, x_discarded.R1.fastq.gz, x_extracted.R1.fastq.gz, x_UMI_counts.json, x_extraction_metrics.json) 
        
        
        ### Extraction with a string pattern ###
        
        The pattern sequence must include one or more Ns, indicating the UMI bases, optionally followed by any nuccleotides corresponding to spacer sequence. 
        For instance the pattern ```NNNNN``` extracts the first 5 nucleotides from the read whereas pattern ```NNNNNATCG``` extracts the first 9 nucleotides, appends nucleotides 1-5 to the read name and discard spacer ```ATCG```. Reads not matching ```NNNNNATCG``` are discarded. 
        
        Extraction with the pattern sequence always extracts UMIs at the beginning of the read sequence. Extraction with regular expression offers more flexibility in the UMI design (see below).
        
        As an example, consider read:
        
        ```
        @MISEQ753:39:000000000-BDH2V:1:1101:17521:1593 1:N:0:
        TCATGTCTGCTAATGGGAAAGAGTGTCCTAACTGTCCCAGATCGTTTTTTCTCACGTCTTTTCTCCTTTCACTTCTCTTTTTCTTTTTCTTTCTTCTTCTT
        +
        1>1A1DDF11DBDGFFA111111D1FEEG31AD1DAA1110BA00000//01A2A/B/B/212D2111D1222D12122B1B01D1@101112@D2D12BB
        ```
        
        Extraction with pattern ```NNNNNNNNNNNNATGGGAAAGAGTGTCC``` will extract UMI ```TCATGTCTGCTA``` and add it to the read name. Spacer sequence ```ATGGGAAAGAGTGTCC``` is removed from read.
        So the new read is now:
        
        ```
        @MISEQ753:39:000000000-BDH2V:1:1101:17521:1593_TCATGTCTGCTA 1:N:0:
        TAACTGTCCCAGATCGTTTTTTCTCACGTCTTTTCTCCTTTCACTTCTCTTTTTCTTTTTCTTTCTTCTTCTT
        +
        G31AD1DAA1110BA00000//01A2A/B/B/212D2111D1222D12122B1B01D1@101112@D2D12BB
        ```
        
        Extracted sequence ```TCATGTCTGCTAATGGGAAAGAGTGTCC``` and its corresponding qualities ```1>1A1DDF11DBDGFFA111111D1FEE``` are written to file ```filename.extracted.fastq.gz```.
        
        ### Extraction with a regular expression ###
        
        Regular expressions allow more flexibility for extracting UMIs, in particular UMIs with complex design and UMIs not starting at the beginning of the read.
        A good introduction to regular expression can be found in this [Regular Expression HOWTO](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/regex.html). 
        BarcodEx depends on the ```regex``` module rather than the standard ```re``` module because the former allows fuzzy matching.
        
        Sequences are extracted from the read using named groups within the regex. Allowed named groups are ```umi``` and ```discard```. Syntax with named groups is as follow:
        ```(?<umi>.{3})(?<discard>T{2})```: extracts a 3bp UMI followed by TT spacer that is removed from read and discarded
        The ```discard``` group removes nucleotides and qualities from the read while the ```umi``` group extracts the UMI that gets added to the read name.
        Any sequence not contained in ```umi``` and ```discard``` groups will remain in the read. Thus, it is important to construct the regular expression such that the begining of the read is captured in groups.
        
        For instance, consider the following read:
        
        ```
        @MISEQ753:39:000000000-BDH2V:1:1101:17521:1593 1:N:0:
        AATCGTCCATCG
        +
        1>1A1DDF11DB
        ```
        
        The regex ```(?<umi>.{3})(?<discard>C{2})``` will extract UMI ```CGT``` and discard spacer ```CC```. But the first 3 nucleotides ```AAT``` will remain in the read with new read being:
        
        ```
        @MISEQ753:39:000000000-BDH2V:1:1101:17521:1593_CGT 1:N:0:
        AATATCG
        +
        1>111DB
        ```
        
        To prevent the ```AAT``` before the UMI ```CGT``` to be part of the read, we need to account for the nucleotides upstream in the UMI in the regex ```(?<discard1>^.*)(?<umi>.{3})(?<discard2>C{2})```
        This is particularly when restoring the original fastqs (see below).
        
        The processed read with annotated UMI becomes:
        
        ```
        @MISEQ753:39:000000000-BDH2V:1:1101:17521:1593_CGT 1:N:0:
        ATCG
        +
        11DB
        ```
        
        And read with extracted sequences and qualities is written to a separate fastq ```filename.extracted.fastq.gz```:
        
        ```
        @MISEQ753:39:000000000-BDH2V:1:1101:17521:1593_CGT 1:N:0:
        AATCGTCC
        +
        1>1A1DDF
        ```
        
        Multiple ```umi``` and ```discard``` named groups are allowed within the regex but they should be named differently. Naming is not important as long as groups contain the strings ```umi``` and ```discard```without special characters.
        For instance the following 2 regex will give the same output:
        - ```(?<discard_1>^.*)(?<umi>.{3})(?<discard_a>C{2})')``` and ```(?<discard1>^.*)(?<umi>.{3})(?<discard2>C{2})')```
        - ```(?P<umi_1>^[ACGT]{3}[ACG])(?P<discard_1>T)|(?P<umi_2>^[ACGT]{3})(?P<discard_2>T)``` and ```(?P<umi_a>^[ACGT]{3}[ACG])(?P<discard_a>T)|(?P<umi_b>^[ACGT]{3})(?P<discard_b>T)```
        
        ### Filtering extracted UMIs against a list ###
        
        The UMIs will only be accepted if they match an allow list provided with --umilist.
        
        The list differs when UMIs are extracted from the read sequences or when they are located in a separate fastq.
        
        When UMIs are located within the read sequences, the list is a text file with one UMI per line. In the case of 2 reads with embedded UMIs, the two parts of the UMI must be on separate lines, optionally followed by the read number they apply to.
        So, AAA would be allowed for either read 1 or read 2, while CCC 2 will allow CCC only on read 2.
        It's also possible to write AAA 1 2 or AAA 1 and AAA 2 if desired.
        
        When UMIs are located in separate fastq, it is assumed that both reads in paired end sequencing should be annotated with the same UMI.
        Here, the list of accepted UMI is simply a 1-column table with valid UMIs that are expected in the separate fastq.
        
        
        ### Extraction of UMIs in single or paired read sequences ### 
        
        Parameters ```--r1_in``` and ```--r2_in``` indicate the paths to the read 1 and read 2 fastqs. ```--r1_in``` is always required and omitting ```--r2_in``` indicates single end sequences. 
        BarcodEx requires gzipped input fastqs and outputs gzipped fastqs. Input fastqs for paired end data must be in sync.
        ```--prefix``` specifies the start of the output files (e.g. foo/bar/x_R1.fastq.gz, foo/bar/x_R2.fastq.gz)
         
        
        ### Extraction from multiple input fastqs ###
        
        Multiple input fastqs can be processed together for read 1 and/or read 2. However, barcodex generates a single output fastq for single end data and 2 output fastqs for paired read data.
        The files mut be passed to ```--r1_in``` for read 1 fastqs and ```--r2_in``` for read 2 fastqs, each file being separated by white space.
        The number of input fastqs for paired data must be the same for read 1 and read 2 and each list of files must be in the same order.
        
        ### Extraction of UMIs not inline with reads ###
        
        Sub-command ```extract inline``` extracts UMIs located within the read sequences while sub-command ```extract separate``` is used to extract UMIs located in fastq.
         
        
        ### Recovery of discarded reads and extracted sequences ###
        
        Reads without a matching pattern are written to file for inspection. ```--prefix``` specifies the start of the output files:
        ```foo/bar/x_discarded.R1.fastq.gz``` and/or ```foo/bar/x_discarded.R2.fastq.gz```.
        Extracted read sequences (UMIs and any spacer sequence removed from read, along with their qualities) are also written to file:
        ```foo/bar/x_extracted.R1.fastq.gz``` and/or ```foo/bar/x_extracted.R2.fastq.gz```.
        
        Similarly, UMIs located in fastq and filtered out with ```--umilist``` are discarded along with the corresponding reads 1 and/or 2 resulting in files:
        ```filename_discarded_umis.fastq.gz```, ```filename_discarded.R1.fastq.gz``` and/or ```filename_discarded.R2.fastq.gz```.
        Valid UMIs are also written to output fastq ```filename_extracted_umis.fastq.gz```. 
                
        
        ### UMIs and reads metrics ###
        
        Two files with metrics of the UMI extraction are written in json format in the same directory specified by ```--prefix```.
        ```--prefix``` foo/bar/x results in  foo/bar/x_extraction_metrics.json and foo/bar/x_UMI_counts.json.
        The first json captures information about the extraction process:
        - total reads/pairs processed
        - number of reads/pairs with matching pattern
        - number of reads/pairs with non-matching pattern
        - number of reads/pairs discarded due to unknown UMI
        - pattern1
        - pattern2
        - umi-list
        
        The second json records the UMI counts after extraction. For paired end data it counts the concatenated sequences with UMIs from read 1 and read 2, adding a "." separator to track the read origin of each UMI.
        For instance, "AAA.TCG": 10 in the json file indicates that sequence AAATCG is found 10 times in all the extracted UMIs, and that it is made of AAA from read 1 and TCG from read 2.
        
        
        ## Restoring original fastqs ## 
        
        BarcodEx restores the original fastqs with the ```restore inline``` or ```restore separate``` sub-commands.
        However, only 1 or 2 output fastqs are generated even if UMI extraction accepts multiple input fastqs. This is equivalent of merging the input fastqs.
        Care should be taken to construct a regex that captures the UMI from the start (or up to the end) of the read if one wishes to restore the original fastqs and read sequences.
        Morever, fastqs with extracted read sequences and/or discarded reads (if any) should be also serve as input fastqs along with the processed fastqs containing annotated reads.
        
        
        ### Restore fastqs from extraction of UMIs in read sequences ###

        Extracts the first 3 nucleotides as UMI and discards the next 2 nucleotide spacer sequence from each read.
        Umis are preceded by an underscore in the read header.
        
        ```
        barcodex --separator "_" --prefix output extract inline --r1_in myfile_R1.fastq.gz --r2_in myfile_R2.fastq.gz --pattern1 "(?<umi>.{3})(?<discard>.{2})" --pattern2 "(?<umi>.{3})(?<discard>.{2})"
        ```
        
        **Example 3. Full match regex option**
        
        Same as Example 2, but the regex patterns are modified to suit the ```--full_match``` regex requirement.
        
        ```
        barcodex --separator "_" --prefix output extract inline --r1_in myfile_R1.fastq.gz --r2_in myfile_R2.fastq.gz --pattern1 "(?<umi>.{3})(?<discard>.{2}.+)" --pattern2 "(?<umi>.{3})(?<discard>.{2}.+)" --full_match
        ```
        
        **Example 4. List of UMIs**
        
        Extraction of UMIs in read 1 and read 2 for paired end data with inline UMIs with a regular expression.
        Extracts a 4 bp UMI not ending with T and discard a following T spacer or a 3 bp UMI and discard the following T spacer.
        UMIs start at the beginning of the read sequence and only higher caps A, T, C and G are allowed.
        Extracted UMIs are checked against the true_barcode.txt UMI list. Reads with non-valid UMIs (ie. not present in true_barcode.txt) are discarded.
        Umis are preceded by an underscore in the read header.
        
        ```
        barcodex --separator "_" --prefix output extract --umilist true_barcodes.txt inline --r1_in myfile_R1.fastq.gz --r2_in myfile_R2.fastq.gz --pattern1 "(?P<umi_1>^[ACGT]{3}[ACG])(?P<discard_1>T)|(?P<umi_2>^[ACGT]{3})(?P<discard_2>T)" --pattern2 "(?P<umi_1>^[ACGT]{3}[ACG])(?P<discard_1>T)|(?P<umi_2>^[ACGT]{3})(?P<discard_2>T)"
        ```
        
        **example 5. Single end**
        
        Extraction of UMIs in read 1 for single end with inline UMIs with a regular expression.
        Extracts the first 12 bp UMI when followed by spacer ATGGGAAAGAGTGTCC and remove spacer from read.
        Umis are preceded by an underscore in the read header.
        
        ```
        barcodex --separator "_" --prefix x extract --umilist true_barcodes.txt inline --r1_in myfile_R1.fastq.gz --pattern1 "(?P<umi>^.{12})(?P<discard>ATGGGAAAGAGTGTCC)" \
        ```
        
        **Example 6. Multiple input fastqs**
        
        Extraction of UMIs in read 1 and read 2 for paired end data with inline UMIs with a regular expression from 4 input fastq1 and 4 input fastq2.
        Extracts the first 3 nucleotides as UMI and discards the next 2 nucleotide spacer sequences from each read.
        Umis are preceded by an underscore in the read header.
        
        ```
        barcodex --separator "_" --prefix output_umis extract --umilist true_barcodes.txt inline --r1_in myfile_R1.1.fastq.gz myfile_R1.2.fastq.gz myfile_R1.3.fastq.gz myfile_R1.4.fastq.gz --r2_in myfile_R2.1.fastq.gz myfile_R2.2.fastq.gz myfile_R2.3.fastq.gz myfile_R2.4.fastq.gz --pattern1 "(?<umi>.{3})(?<discard>.{2})" --pattern2 "(?<umi>.{3})(?<discard>.{2})" 
        ```
        
        **Example 7. Paired end with UMIs in file**
        
        Extraction of UMIs in read 1 and read 2 for paired end data with UMIs located in read 3 with a regular expression.
        Extracts the first 10 nucleotides as UMI. Umis are preceded by an underscore in the read header.
        
        ```
        barcodex --separator "_" --prefix foo/bar/myfastq.umis extract separate --r1_in myfile_R1.fastq.gz --r2_in myfile_R2.fastq.gz --ru_in myfile_R3.fastq.gz
        ```
        
        **Example 8. Importing BarcodEx as module within a script to extract UMIs**
        
        Sample as Example 2.
        
        ```
        import gzip
        from itertools import zip_longest
        import regex
        import json
        import time
        from barcodex import extract_barcodes_inline
        
        
        extract_barcodes_inline(['myfile_R1.fastq.gz'], pattern1='(?<umi>.{3})(?<discard>.{2})', prefix='x',
                           pattern2='(?<umi>.{3})(?<discard>.{2})', r2_in=['myfile_R2.fastq.gz'], full_match=False, separator='_', umilist=None)
        
        ```
        
        **Example 9. Importing BarcodEx as module within a script to restore fastqs**
        
        Generate input fastqs before extraction of inline UMIs.
         
        
        ```
        import gzip
        from itertools import zip_longest
        import regex
        import json
        import time
        from barcodex import reconstruct_fastqs_inline
        
        reconstruct_fastqs_inline('x', '_', '5prime', 'filename_R1.fastq.gz', 'filename_extracted.R1.fastq.gz', 'filename_discarded.R1.fastq.gz', 'filename_R1.fastq.gz', 'filename_extracted.R2.fastq.gz', 'filename_discarded.R2.fastq.gz')
        ```
        
        **Example 10. Restore paired-end fastqs from inline-UMI extraction**
        
        Inline UMIs were extracted from read 1 and read 2 and added to read names with a "_" separator. The same separator variable should be use to restore the original fastqs.
        UMIs were extracted from the 5' read end.
        
        ```
        barcodex --separator "_" --prefix my_fastqs restore inline  --umi_pos 5prime --r1_processed x_R1_fastq.gz --r2_processed x_R2_fastq.gz --r1_extracted x_extracted.R1.fastq.gz --r2_extracted x_extracted.R2.fastq.gz --r1_discarded x_discarded.R1.fastq.gz --r2_discarded x_discarded.R2.fastq.gz
        ```
        
        **Example 11. Restore single-end fastq with UMI located in separate file**
        
        UMIs located in separate file were added to read 1 "_" separator.
        Some UMIs were filtered out with a umilist.
        
        ```
        barcodex --separator "_" --prefix my_fastqs restore separate --r1_processed x_R1_fastq.gz --r1_discarded x_discarded.R1.fastq.gz --umi_extracted x__extracted_umis.fastq.gz --umi_discarded x_discarded_umis.fastq.gz
        ```
