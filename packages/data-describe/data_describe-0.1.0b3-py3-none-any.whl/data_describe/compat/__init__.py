"""data-describe compatibility and checks.

data-describe makes use of a wide range of Python dependencies that
are not applicable (and thus not required) for all users. The logic for
handling these optional dependencies (e.g. lazy-loading) is implemented here.

Note:
    This subpackage is typically not used by end users of data-describe.
