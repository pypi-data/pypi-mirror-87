This package aims to simplify post-processing of MIKE model results into GIS formats.

The main objectives are to:

    -Create an overall framework for post-processing models in batch
    -Provide several useful scripts that simplify common post-processing tasks
    -Offer an easy to use interfaces for both python and non-python users
    -Enable the package to be easily extended with new scripts

For now, the package is dependent on arcpy which requires an ArcGIS license.
