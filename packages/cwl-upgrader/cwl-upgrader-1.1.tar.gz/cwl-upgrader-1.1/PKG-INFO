Description: =====================================================
        Common workflow language standalone document upgrader
        =====================================================
        
        This is a standalone upgrader for Common Workflow Language documents from
        version "draft-3" to "v1.0".
        
        It does not check for correctness of the input document, for that one can use
        the CWL reference implementation.
        
        This is written and tested for Python 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, and 3.8.
