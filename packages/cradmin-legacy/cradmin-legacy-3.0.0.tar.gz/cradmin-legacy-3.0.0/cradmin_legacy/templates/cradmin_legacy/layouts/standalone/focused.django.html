    You can replace this template in your own project, and
    override stuff from focused-internal.django.html. This means
    that you can put ``cradmin_legacy/layouts/standalone/focused.django.html`` in
    your own project, and override it without having to reimplement
    anything.

    .. note:: Make sure you put the Django app overriding this template
        after ``cradmin_legacy`` in ``INSTALLED_APPS``.

    .. note:: We will NEVER add anything to this template by default.
