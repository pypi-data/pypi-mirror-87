#: Interactive real-time demo of the power of multi-element stimuli
"""
This demo shows how large numbers of independent elements can be
animated and made to respond in real time.

A single `Shady.Stimulus`, while usually rendered as a rectangle,
can be rendered as anything up to 20,000 independent points. If these
are managed as a `numpy` array, and manipulated in a "vectorized" way
such that the bulk of the arithmetic operations happen in compiled
binaries, these points can be animated in quite sophisticated ways,
well within 60 fps deadlines (verify this with `--gauge` and/or
`--debugTiming` provided you have numpy and matplotlib installed)

An `n`-sided polygon uses up `n+1` points, so for polygons, when you
specify `--nsides=3`  or above, the number of independent polygons
`--ndots=m` is limited by `(n+1)*m <= 20000`

A line segment uses up just 2 points, so for line segments, you can
specify either `--nsides=2` or `--nsides=1` (both are equivalent)
and then the number of independent segments can be anything up to
`--ndots=10000`.

Move the mouse around / touch the touch-screen to interact with the
shapes.

	First let's create a shape.  For nsides > 2 we'll use a polygon,
	delimited by a NaN. A special case will be nsides=1 or nsides=2
	both of which will be interpreted to mean that each shape is a single
	line segment. In that case the "LINES" draw-mode will be used, and
	that draws a separate line segment connecting the points in each
	successive pair, so we can omit the NaN-break between shapes (we don't
	have to, but it increases the max number of shapes we can use by 50%).
