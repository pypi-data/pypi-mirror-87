        [InteractionFree]() is a remote procedure call (RPC) protocol based on [ZeroMQ](https://zeromq.org). It allows the developers to build their own distributed and cross-languige program easily. The protocol is config-less and extremly easy to use. Currently, [Msgpack](https://msgpack.org) is used for binary serialization. InteractionFree implementation is already available in various languages (including Scala, Javascript, Arduino). More infomation will be available soon.
        
        - InteractionFree specification: to be drafted.
        
        
        
        ## Quick Start
        
         **Install**
        
        ```shell
        $ pip install interactionfreepy
        ```
        
        **Start the server**
        
        ```python
        from interactionfreepy import IFBroker
        
        broker = IFBroker('tcp://*:port')
        IFLoop.join()
        ```
        
        replace `port` to any port number that is available.
        
        `IFLoop.join()` is a utility function to prevent the program from finishing.
        
        **Start a worker**
        
        ```python
        from interactionfreepy import IFWorker
        
        class Target():
            def tick(self, message):
                return "tack %s" % message
        
        worker = IFWorker('tcp://address:port', 'TargetService', Target())
        IFLoop.join()
        ```
        
        replace `address` and `port` to the server's net address and port.
        
        **Start a client**
        
        ```python
        from interactionfreepy import IFWorker
        
        client = IFWorker('tcp://address:port')
        print(client.TargetService.tick('now'))
        ```
