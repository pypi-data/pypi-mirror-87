    How to increase requests rate limit

Use the command `auth` to increase your requests rate limit. You will need a token: read this [article](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token) to learn about the personal access token.

This is still `beta`, quickly built to facilitate the installation of Python desktop application `Pyrustic`. If you don't know what `Pyrustic` is, check its [README](https://github.com/pyrustic/geet).

Do you have published some nice Python desktop application release on Github ?

Let assume that your github profile is `pyrusticfan` with a repository named `disrupt`.
What do you prefer:
- do you want your users to go to RELEASES tab, download the asset, unpack the asset in the right folder then install the app ?

  or just

- `geet pyrusticfan/disrupt`


I think that the choice is easy to do.


<br><br>


If you want your users to download and install your application with Geet, so follow the next principles:

- your asset should be a zip file.
- that's all.

Also, respect this structure:
- whatever-name.zip
    - repository-name-please
        - whatever-folder
        - whatever-source-code
        - blah blah blah

As you can see, it is important to have your project inside a folder named as your repository. If you use [Pyrustic](https://github.com/pyrustic/pyrustic) to publish your nice desktop applications on Github, you won't need to care about this detail.
