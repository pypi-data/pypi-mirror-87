quikml
==============================

Built on top of sklearn and keras, the quikml library is used to easily train, test, visualize, and assess the performance of your machine learning classification models. Whether you are beginner or advanced, this module will let you do more without the coding hassle of other machine learning modules.

With this module, you will be able to do all classical machine learning assessments with ease.
