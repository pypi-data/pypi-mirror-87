    long_description="More Collections\n================\n\nSome useful data structures for collections of data\n\n\n### Class `Index`\n\nProvide indexing for a list. Inner properties can be used for keys, and keys can be tuples of properties.  \n\n### Class `UniqueIndex`\n\nSame as Index, but includes checks and optimization to ensure members' keys are unique.\n\n### Class `Queue`\n\nA `Queue` is a list, with `add()` and `pop()`. It ensures members in the queue are not duplicated by not adding the ones already found in the queue.\n\n### Class `Matrix`\n\nA multidimensional grid of values that can be used like a `Mapping` from a-tuple-of-coordinates to the value at that coordinate. Plus a few other convenience methods.\n\nThis is a naive implementation. The hope it is a simple facade to a faster implementation.\n\n### Class `Relation`\n\nStore the many-to-many relations between two domains     ",
