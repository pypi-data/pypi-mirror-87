**Beartype decorator.**

This private submodule implements the core :func:`beartype` decorator as well
as ancillary functions called by that decorator. The :mod:`beartype.__init__`
submodule then imports the former for importation as the public
:mod:`beartype.beartype` decorator by downstream callers -- completing the
virtuous cycle of code life.

This private submodule is *not* intended for importation by downstream callers.
'''

# ....................{ TODO                              }....................
#FIXME: [FEATURE] Define the following supplementary decorators:
#* @beartype.beartype_O1(), identical to the current @beartype.beartype()
#  decorator but provided for disambiguity. This decorator only type-checks
#  exactly one item from each container for each call rather than all items.
#* @beartype.beartype_Ologn(), type-checking log(n) random items from each
#  container of "n" items for each call.
#* @beartype.beartype_On(), type-checking all items from each container for
#  each call. We have various ideas littered about GitHub on how to optimize
#  this for various conditions, but this is never going to be ideal and should
#  thus never be the default.
#
#To differentiate between these three strategies, consider:
#* Declare an enumeration in "beartype._decor._data" resembling:
#    from enum import Enum
#    BeartypeStrategyKind = Enum('BeartypeStrategyKind ('O1', 'Ologn', 'On',))
#* Define a new "BeartypeData.strategy_kind" instance variable.
#* Set this variable to the corresponding "BeartypeStrategyKind" enumeration
#  member based on which of the three decorators listed above was called.
#* Explicitly pass the value of the "BeartypeData.strategy_kind" instance
#  variable to the beartype._decor._code._pep._pephint.pep_code_check_hint()
#  function as a new memoized "strategy_kind" parameter.
#* Conditionally generate type-checking code throughout that function depending
#  on the value of that parameter.

#FIXME: Ensure that *ALL* calls to memoized callables throughout the codebase
#are called with purely positional rather than keyword arguments. Currently, we
#suspect the inverse is the case. To do so, we'll probably want to augment the
#wrapper closure returned by the @callable_cached decorator to emit non-fatal
#warnings when called with non-empty keyword arguments.
#
#Alternately, we might simply want to prohibit keyword arguments altogether by
#defining a new @callable_cached_positional decorator restricted to positional
#arguments. Right... That probably makes more sense. Make it so, ensign!
#
#Then, for generality:
#
#* Preserve the existing @callable_cached decorator as is. We won't be using
#  it, but there's little sense in destroying something beautiful.
#* Globally replace all existing "@callable_cached" substrings with
#  "@callable_cached_positional". Voila!

#FIXME: *CRITICAL EDGE CASE:* If the passed "func" is a coroutine, that
#coroutine *MUST* be called preceded by the "await" keyword rather than merely
#called as is. Detecting coroutines is trivial, thankfully: e.g.,
#
#    if inspect.iscoroutinefunction(func):
#
#Actually, shouldn't that be the more general-purpose test:
#
#    if inspect.isawaitable(func):
#
#The latter seems more correct. In any case, given that:
#
#* Modify the "CODE_CALL_CHECKED" and "CODE_CALL_UNCHECKED" snippets to
#  conditionally precede the function call with the substring "await ": e.g.,
#      CODE_CALL_UNCHECKED = '''
#          return {func_await}__beartype_func(*args, **kwargs)
#      '''
#  Note the absence of delimiting space. This is, of course, intentional.
#* Unconditionally format the "func_await" substring into both of those
#  snippets, define ala:
#      format_await = 'await ' if inspect.iscoroutinefunction(func) else ''
#* Oh, and note that our defined wrapper function must also be preceded by the
#  "async " keyword. So, we'll also need to augment "CODE_SIGNATURE".
#FIXME: Unit test this extensively, please.

#FIXME: Non-critical optimization: if the active Python interpreter is already
#performing static type checking (e.g., with Pyre or mypy), @beartype should
#unconditionally reduce to a noop for the current process. Note that:
#
#* Detecting static type checking is trivial, as PEP 563 standardizes the newly
#  declared "typing.TYPE_CHECKING" boolean constant to be true only if static
#  type checking is currently occurring. Note that @beartype supports this now.
#* Detecting whether static type checking just occurred is clearly less
#  trivial and possibly even infeasible. We're unclear what exactly separates
#  the "static type checking" phase from the runtime phase performed by static
#  type checkers, but something clearly does. If all else fails, we can
#  probably attempt to detect whether the basename of the command invoked by
#  the parent process matches "(Pyre|mypy|pyright|pytype)" or... something. Of
#  course, that itself is non-trivial due to Windows, so here we are. *sigh*

#FIXME: Emit one non-fatal warning for each annotated type that is either:
#
#* "beartype.cave.UnavailableType".
#* "beartype.cave.UnavailableTypes".
#
#Both cases imply user-side misconfiguration, but not sufficiently awful enough
#to warrant fatal exceptions. Moreover, emitting warnings rather than
#exceptions enables end users to unconditionally disable all unwanted warnings,
#whereas no such facilities exist for unwanted exceptions.
#FIXME: Validate all tuple annotations to be non-empty *EXCLUDING*
#"beartype.cave.UnavailableTypes", which is intentionally empty.
#FIXME: Unit test the above edge case.

#FIXME: Add support for all possible kinds of parameters. @beartype currently
#supports most but *NOT* all types. Specifically:
#
#* Type-check variadic keyword arguments. Currently, only variadic positional
#  arguments are type-checked. When doing so, remove the
#  "Parameter.VAR_KEYWORD" type from the "_PARAM_KIND_IGNORABLE" set.
#* Type-check positional-only arguments under Python >= 3.8. Note that, since
#  C-based callables have *ALWAYS* supported positional-only arguments, the
#  "Parameter.POSITIONAL_ONLY" type is defined for *ALL* Python versions
#  despite only being usable in actual Python from Python >= 3.8. In other
#  words, support for type-checking positional-only arguments should be added
#  unconditionally without reference to Python version -- we suspect, anyway.
#  When doing so, remove the "Parameter.POSITIONAL_ONLY" type from the
#  "_PARAM_KIND_IGNORABLE" set.
#* Remove the "_PARAM_KIND_IGNORABLE" set entirely.

'''
Dictionary mapping from the name to value of all attributes internally
accessed as globals (rather than as locals externally passed as private default
parameters) in wrapping functions created and returned by the :func:`beartype`
decorator.

The names of these attributes are embedded in one or more string global
constants declared by one or more snippet submodules (e.g.,
:mod:`beartype._decor._code.codesnip`). To avoid colliding with the names of
arbitrary caller-defined parameters, these names *must* be aliased under
alternate names prefixed by ``__beartype_``.

Caveats
----------
**Attributes frequently accessed in the body of these functions should instead
be externally passed as default parameters into these functions.** This
includes the frequently accessed ``__beartypistry`` local, which is thus passed
as a private default parameter to the signatures of these functions.

    '''
    Decorate the passed **callable** (e.g., function, method) to validate both
    all annotated parameters passed to this callable *and* the annotated value
    returned by this callable if any.

    This decorator performs rudimentary type checking based on Python 3.x
    function annotations, as officially documented by PEP 484 ("Type Hints").
    While PEP 484 supports arbitrarily complex type composition, this decorator
    requires *all* parameter and return value annotations to be either:

    * Classes (e.g., :class:`int`, :class:`OrderedDict`).
    * Tuples of classes (e.g., ``(int, OrderedDict)``).

    If optimizations are enabled by the active Python interpreter (e.g., due to
    option ``-O`` passed to this interpreter), this decorator reduces to a
    noop.

    Parameters
    ----------
    func : CallableTypes
        **Non-class callable** (i.e., callable object that is *not* a class) to
        be decorated by a dynamically generated new callable wrapping this
        original callable with pure-Python type-checking.

    Returns
    ----------
    CallableTypes
        Dynamically generated new callable wrapping this original callable with
        pure-Python type-checking.

    Raises
    ----------
    BeartypeDecorHintException
        If any annotation on this callable is neither:

        * A **PEP-compliant type** (i.e., instance or class complying with a
          PEP supported by :mod:`beartype`), including:

          * `PEP 484`_ types (i.e., instance or class declared by the stdlib
            :mod:`typing` module).

        * A **PEP-noncompliant type** (i.e., instance or class complying with
          :mod:`beartype`-specific semantics rather than a PEP), including:

          * **Fully-qualified forward references** (i.e., strings specified as
            fully-qualified classnames).
          * **Tuple unions** (i.e., tuples containing one or more classes
            and/or forward references).
    BeartypeDecorParamNameException
        If the name of any parameter declared on this callable is prefixed by
        the reserved substring ``__beartype_``.
    BeartypeDecorHintPep563Exception
        If `PEP 563`_ is active for this callable and evaluating a **postponed
        annotation** (i.e., annotation whose value is a string) on this
        callable raises an exception (e.g., due to that annotation referring to

    # function called below explicitly ignores filenames matching that
    # syntactic format, presumably due to the standard fake module filename
    # "<string>" applied by default to Python code dynamically generated by
    # the eval() and exec() builtins. Since Python occasionally emits in-memory
