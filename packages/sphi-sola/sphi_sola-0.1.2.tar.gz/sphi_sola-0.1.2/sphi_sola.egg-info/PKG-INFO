Description: Sphinx theme based on Solarized colour palette
        ==============================================
        
        This is a `Sphinx <http://sphinx-doc.org>`_ theme forked from the builtin
        *Haiku* theme. It uses the colour palette from
        `Solarized <https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/>`_ by Ethan Schoonover.
        
        The overall theme uses the light Solarized variant, with all the code
        sections being displayed through the Python package
        `pygments-style-solarized <https://pypi.org/project/pygments-style-solarized/>`_
        in the dark Solarized variant.
        
        
        
        HISTORY
        =======
        
        0.1.2 — 2020-12-01
            The top and bottom nav's content moved around horizontally, based on the
            width of the previous/last page's title. With this revision I made the items
            in the navbar flex items with a fixed width. This fixes certain parts of the
            navbar in place, regardless if the title lengths.
        
        0.1.1 — 2019-09-25
            reduced footer lines from 3 to 2
