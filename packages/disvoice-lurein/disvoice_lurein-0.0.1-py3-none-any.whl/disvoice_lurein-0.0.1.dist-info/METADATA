# DisVoice

!![Image](https://github.com/jcvasquezc/DisVoice/blob/master/docs/logos/disvoice_logo.png?raw=true)

DisVoice is a python framework designed to compute features from speech files. Disvoice computes glottal, phonation, articulation, prosody, and phonological-based features both from sustained vowels and continuous speech utterances with the aim to recognize praliguistic aspects from speech.
The features can be used in classifiers to recognize emotions, or communication capabilities of patients with different speech disorders including diseases with functional origin such as larinx cancer or nodules; craneo-facial based disorders such as hipernasality developed by cleft-lip and palate; or neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's or Hungtinton's diseases.

For additional information please see [glottal](https://github.com/jcvasquezc/DisVoice/tree/master/glottal), [phonation](https://github.com/jcvasquezc/DisVoice/tree/master/phonation), [articulaton](https://github.com/jcvasquezc/DisVoice/tree/master/articulation), [prosody](https://github.com/jcvasquezc/DisVoice/tree/master/prosody), and [phonological](https://github.com/jcvasquezc/DisVoice/tree/master/phonological) directories.
