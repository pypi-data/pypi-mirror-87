        ##### Python Environment and Style
        It's recommended to use the Pycharm IDE for making contributions. You can get it for free here: https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/. This will help you catch style and syntax issues early. 
        
        We will try to follow PEP 8 whenever possible as documented here: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/. If you use Pycharm then you won't need to read this because it will highlight issues for you :). 
        
        ### Installing Genreml
        Install dependencies
        Mac:
        ```
        brew install ffmpeg
        ```
        
        Ubuntu/Debian:
        ```
        sudo apt-get install ffmpeg
        ```
        
        To install the package from Pypi as documented in https://pypi.org/project/genreml run:
        ```
        pip3 install genreml
        or
        pip install genreml
        ```
        
        To install the package from the repo with Unix-based OS run the following in CS467-Project directory
        ```
        bash install.sh
        ```
        
        Test the installation by running the following in your terminal:
        ```
        genreml
        ```
        
        If the installation fails, ensure you have pip installed and that pip is correctly mapped (it may be pip3 on your system). If the genreml command
        doesn't work then run the following as the entry point to the CLI.
        ```
        python3 -m model
        ```
        
        Alternatively, you can travel to the src/model and run the following as the main entry point without installing the app
        ```
        python3 __main__.py
        ```
        
        # Deploying the Webapp
        The webapp is being hosted on an us-east-2 EC2 instance in AWS account 146066720211. The public IPv4 address is 3.135.235.199
        and the public IPv4 DNS is ec2-3-135-235-199.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com.
        
        To deploy the webapp you will need to have SSH access to this instance. The key being used is available in 
        https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fc8yxqEZlNGF2s5lqqqSsr_oKaBHHcmA/view?usp=sharing to OSU students. To connect to the
        instance you can run ssh -i "MyKey4.pem" ubuntu@ec2-3-135-235-199.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com from the same directory
        as where MyKey4.pem is stored on your machine or provide a path to MyKey4.pem after -i argument like 
        ssh -i "/Users/adamsrosales/Downloads/MyKey4.pem" ubuntu@ec2-3-135-235-199.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com.
        
        There is a shell script in this repo (deploy_webapp.sh) that copies the contents of the webapp to the right location on the
        EC2 machine. You will need to provide the location of the private key on your machine when running it like so:
        bash deploy_webapp.sh /Users/adamsrosales/Downloads/MyKey4.pem.
        
        The deployment is configured like so.
        
        In /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/ there's a file called app with the following configuration which is the nginx
        configuration for hosting the site.
        
        ```
        server {
            listen 80;
            server_name 3.135.235.199;
        
            location / {
                proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8000;
                proxy_set_header Host $host;
                proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
            }
        } 
        ```
        
        If you make any changes run deploy_webapp.sh to copy the contents of the webapp to the server and run:
        
        ```
        sudo nginx -s reload
        sudo supervisorctl reload
        ```
        
        To contents of the webapp are found in /home/ubuntu/webapp and they're being run by gunicorn. To
        see all the gunicorn processes run
        
        ```
        ps ax|grep gunicorn
        ```
        
        To kill the gunicorn processes run
        
        ```
        sudo pkill gunicorn
        ```
        
        To start the gunicorn process run this from the /home/ubuntu/webapp directory. This will start the site hosting.
        ```
        gunicorn -w 2 frontend:app
        ```
        
        The site can be accessed by traveling to the public EC2 DNS name: 
        ```
        http://ec2-3-12-132-1.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com/
        ```
        
        # Running the CLI
        
        **The youtube functionality is not currently working due to youtube-dl takedown**
        
        Downloading audio files to your machine (**This is no longer working due to youtube-dl takedown**)
        ```
        genreml download -s "Black Dog" -a "Led Zeppelin"
        ```
        
        You can do the same without installing the app by traveling to the model package and running
        ```
        python3 __main__.py download -s "Black Dog" -a "Led Zeppelin"
        ```
        
        Processing audio files stored in some drive on your machine
        ```
        genreml process -fp "/Users/adamsrosales/Documents/audio-clips/"
        ```
        
        You can do the same without installing the app by traveling to the model package and running
        ```
        python3 __main__.py process -fp "/Users/adamsrosales/Documents/audio-clips/"
        ```
        
        The same can be run with a single file
        ```
        genreml process -fp "/Users/adamsrosales/Documents/audio-clips/Yummy_Justin Bieber_clip.wav"
        ```
        
        To ignore certain features from the feature extraction process
        ```
        # Ignore spectrogram generation
        genreml process -fp "/Users/adamsrosales/Documents/audio-clips/fma_small/000" -e spectrogram
        ```
        
        To change audio file type
        ```
        genreml process -fp "/Users/adamsrosales/Documents/audio-clips/fma_small/000" -af mp3
        ```
        
        To change export color images and change image size to X in wide by Y in high
        ```
        genreml process -fp "/Users/adamsrosales/Documents/audio-clips/fma_small/000" -cmap None -fw 15.0 -fh 5.0
        ```
        
        To predict genres from an audio file
        ```
        genreml classify -fp "/Users/adamsrosales/Documents/audio-clips/fma_small/000/000002.mp3"
        ```
        
        To predict genres from a youtube URL
        ```
        genreml classify -yu "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui-_IUylvoA"
        ```
        
        To predict genres from a compatible h5 model
        ```
        genreml classify -mp "/Users/adamsrosales/Downloads/FMA_model.h5" -yu "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui-_IUylvoA"
        ```
        
        # Using genreml as a Package in Python
        
        You can import genreml after a successful installation like any Python package
        ```
        import genreml
        ```
        
        See genreml/model/__main__ for the hooks into the genreml functionality that the CLI has. Some examples below.
        
        Run feature extraction on sample FMA MP3s packaged with application.
        ```
        from genreml.model.processing import audio
        
        audio_files = audio.AudioFiles()
        audio_files.extract_sample_fma_features()
        ```
        
        Run feature extraction on already loaded data.
        ```
        from genreml.model.processing import audio
        
        audio_files = audio.AudioFiles()
        audio_files.extract_sample_fma_features()
        
        # Get the raw audio data from already loaded files
        audio_signal_data = []
        sample_rate_data = []
        for _, audio_obj in audio_files_processor.items():
            audio_signal_data.append(audio_obj.audio_signal)
            sample_rate_data.append(audio_obj.sample_rate)
        
        # Use that raw data for feature extraction with AudioData class
        audio_data_processor = AudioData(audio_signal_data, sample_rate_data)
        audio_data_processor.extract_features()
        ```
        
        audio.AudioFiles() and AudioData() just create a dictionary of individual file paths to audio data. 
        You can extract the data from the collection as you would with any dictionary.
        ```
        audio_signals = []
        sample_rates = []
        for audio_key, object in audio_files.items():
            audio_signals.append(object.audio_rate)
            sample_rates.append(object.sample_rates)
        ```
        
        You can also get all of the visual and non-visual features extracted from the audio collection itself.
        ```
        my_features = audio_files.features
        my_visual_features = audio_files.visual_features
        ```
        
        Convert features to Pandas data frame
        ```
        df = audio_files.to_df()
        ```
        
        Run feature extraction on a directory or filepath of your choice
        ```
        audio_files.extract_features("[YOUR_FILE_PATH]")
        ```
        
        Run feature extraction on a directory or filepath of your choice but export results to a destination filepath
        ```
        audio_files.extract_features("[YOUR_FILE_PATH]", destination_filepath="[YOUR_DESTINATION_PATH]")
        ```
        
        Change color of images generated from feature extraction
        ```
        audio_files.extract_features("[YOUR_FILE_PATH]", destination_filepath="[YOUR_DESTINATION_PATH]", cmap=None)
        ```
        
        Change size of images generated to 15 by 5 inches
        ```
        audio_files.extract_features(
            "[YOUR_FILE_PATH]", destination_filepath="[YOUR_DESTINATION_PATH]",
            figure_width=15, figure_height=5
        )
        ```
