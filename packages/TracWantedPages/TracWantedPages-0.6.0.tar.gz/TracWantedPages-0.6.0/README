You must have setuptools installed.

Run the following commands in the source directory:
{{{#!sh
  python setup.py bdist_egg
  cp dist/*.egg /path/to/projenv/plugins
}}}

== Syntax
[[WantedPages]] or [[WantedPages(show_referrers)]]

Will yield a list of wanted wiki pages or a list of wanted wiki pages with
a list of pages where the wanted wiki page link was found, respectively.

More options:
- ignored_referrers: regex that identifies referring pages
- filter: alias for ignored_referrers
- filtertype: inclusive|exclusive, flags whether filter option is inclusive
  or exclusive, default is exclusive (for backward compatibility)

Examples:
- ignore all pages that contain 'Trac' in their name:
  [[WantedPages(show_referrers,ignored_referrers=Trac)]]
  [[WantedPages(show_referrers,ignored_referrers=Trac,filtertype=exclusive)]]
  [[WantedPages(show_referrers,filter=Trac)]]
  [[WantedPages(show_referrers,filter=Trac,filtertype=exclusive)]]
- only show pages that contain 'Trac' in their name:
  [[WantedPages(show_referrers,ignored_referrers=Trac,filtertype=inclusive)]]
  [[WantedPages(show_referrers,filter=Trac,filtertype=inclusive)]]
