        Todoman is a simple, standards-based, cli todo (aka: task) manager. Todos
        are stored into `icalendar <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5545>`_ files, which
        means you can sync them via `CalDAV <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CalDAV>`_
        using, for example, `vdirsyncer <https://vdirsyncer.readthedocs.org/>`_.
        
        Todoman is now part of the ``pimutils`` project, and is hosted at `GitHub
        <https://github.com/pimutils/todoman>`_.
        
        Todoman should run fine on any Unix-like OS. It's been tested on GNU/Linux,
        BSD, and macOS.  We do not support windows, and very basic testing seems to
        indicate it does not work.
        
        Features
        --------
        
        * Listing, editing and creating todos.
        * Todos are read from individual ics files from the configured directory. This
          matches the `vdir <https://vdirsyncer.readthedocs.org/en/latest/vdir.html>`_
          specification.
        * There's support for the most common TODO features for now (summary,
          description, location, due date and priority) for now.
        * Todoman should run on any major operating system (except Windows).
        * Unsupported fields may not be shown but are *never* deleted or altered.
