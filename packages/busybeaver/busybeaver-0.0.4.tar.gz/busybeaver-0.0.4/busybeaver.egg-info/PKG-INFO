Description: # busybeaver
        This package aims to simplify post-processing of MIKE model results into GIS formats.
        
        The main objectives are to:
        
            -Create an overall framework for post-processing models in batch
            -Provide several useful scripts that simplify common post-processing tasks
            -Offer an easy to use interfaces for both python and non-python users
            -Enable the package to be easily extended with new scripts
        
        For now, the package is dependent on arcpy which requires an ArcGIS license.
