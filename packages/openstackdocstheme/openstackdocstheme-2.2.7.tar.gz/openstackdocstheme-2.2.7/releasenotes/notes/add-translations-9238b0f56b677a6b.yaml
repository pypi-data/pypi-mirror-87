    Add tools for building translated documents. The file
    ``docstheme-build-translated.sh`` will look for translations and
    build translated documents for all languages that exist.
    Invoke ``docstheme-build-translated.sh`` from tox.ini instead of running
    ``sphinx-build`` directly.
    The following environment variables control the script:
    ``SKIP_SPHINX_WARNINGS`` to not treat warnings from sphinx-build as an
    error.
    ``SPHINX_WARNINGS_TRANS`` will turn on warnings by sphinx-build as
    an error on translation (use with caution).

    Example for tox.ini:

    ::

      [testenv:docs]
      deps = -r{toxinidir}/doc/requirements.txt
      setenv =
          SKIP_SPHINX_WARNINGS=1
      commands=
          docstheme-build-translated.sh
