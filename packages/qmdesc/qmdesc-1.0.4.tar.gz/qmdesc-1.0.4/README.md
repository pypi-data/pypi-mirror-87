A trained multitask constraint message passing neural networks 
for QM atomic/bond property predictions as described in the paper 
[Regio-Selectivity Prediction with a Machine-Learned Reaction Representation and On-the-Fly Quantum Mechanical Descriptors](https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv.12907316.v1).

QM descriptors under B3LYP/def2svp level of theory that can be predicted with this model:
1. Hirshfeld partial charge
2. Neucleuphilic Fukui indices
3. Electrophilic Fukui indices
4. NMR shielding constants
5. Bond lengths
6. Bond orders
