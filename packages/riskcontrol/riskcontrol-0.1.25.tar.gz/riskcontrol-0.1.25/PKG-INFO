        ### riskcontrol
        Riskcontrol is used for risk control modeling in Python.
         
        It provides intuitive tools for
        - feature information-value (iv)
        - plot bad rate of bins based on decision tree
        - ks plot
        - feature info describe for external data validation(contain missing analysis)
        - two feature heat map for cross analysis
        - logistic credit card
        - gps near geohash coding
        
        #### install
        ```
        pip install riskcontrol
        ```
        
        #### Usage
        ```python
        import riskcontrol as rc
        import pandas as pd
        
        data = pd.read_csv('test.csv')
        
        rc.feature_miss_ana(data) # data analysis report
        
        rc.split_box_plot_new(data, col_name) # bins bad rate plot
        
        rc.ks_compute(data, col_name) 
        
        rc.create_geohash(latitude, longitude, radius, precision)
        ```
