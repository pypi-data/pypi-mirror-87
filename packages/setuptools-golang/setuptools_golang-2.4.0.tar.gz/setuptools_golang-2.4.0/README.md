setuptools-golang
=================

A setuptools extension for building cpython extensions written in golang.

## Requirements

This requires golang >= 1.5.  It is currently tested against 1.10 and 1.11.

This requires python >= 3.6.  It is currently tested against python3 and pypy3.

## Platform Support

- linux
- macOS
- win32 (32 bit cpython, 32 bit go 1.10+)

## Usage

Add `setuptools-golang` to the `setup_requires` in your setup.py and
`build_golang={'root': ...}`.  `root` refers to the root go import path of
your project.

An extension must be a single file in the `main` go package (though the entire
`main` package will be built into the extension).  That package may import
other code.
You may have multiple extensions in your `setup.py`.

```python
setup(
    ...
    build_golang={'root': 'github.com/user/project'},
    ext_modules=[Extension('example', ['example.go'])],
    setup_requires=['setuptools-golang'],
    ...
)
```

## Writing cpython extensions in golang

Here's some [examples](https://github.com/asottile/setuptools-golang-examples)

## Common issues

### ```undefined reference to `some_c_function'```

`Extension` by default will bring along the go files listed, but won't bring
along the related C files.  Add the following to `MANIFEST.in`:

```
global-include *.c
global-include *.go
```

### `fatal: could not read Username for 'https://github.com':`

You're probably trying to import from an external source which does not exist.
Double check that your import is correct.


### `package github.com/a/b/c: /tmp/.../github.com/a/b exists but /tmp/.../github.com/a/b/.git does not - stale checkout?`

You've probably mistyped an import.  Double check that your import is correct.

### `duplicate symbol _XXX in: _cgo_export.o mod.cgo2.o`

For example:
```
# github.com/asottile/dockerfile/pylib
duplicate symbol _PyDockerfile_GoParseError in:
    $WORK/github.com/asottile/dockerfile/pylib/_obj/_cgo_export.o
    $WORK/github.com/asottile/dockerfile/pylib/_obj/main.cgo2.o
```

Make sure to mark global variables defined in C as `extern`.
[Here's an example PR](https://github.com/asottile/dockerfile/pull/8)

### repeated rebuilds can be slow

setuptools-golang attempts to make builds more repeatable by using a separate
`GOPATH` -- if you'd like to reuse a GOPATH you can set the
`SETUPTOOLS_GOLANG_GOPATH` environment variable:

```console
$ SETUPTOOLS_GOLANG_GOPATH=~/go pip install .
...
```

## Building manylinux wheels

`setuptools-golang` also provides a tool for building
[PEP 513](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0513/) manylinux1 wheels so your
consumers don't need to have a go compiler installed to use your library.

Simply run `setuptools-golang-build-manylinux-wheels` from your source
directory.  The resulting wheels will end up in `./dist`.

```
$ setuptools-golang-build-manylinux-wheels

...

+ ls /dist -al
