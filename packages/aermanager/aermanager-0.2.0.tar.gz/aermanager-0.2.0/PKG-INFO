Description: # aermanager
        *Python package for managing AER data, including .aedat4 files, live DV streams, and interfacing with pyTorch.*
        
        This software is designed for the following purposes:
        - Read aedat files (v2-4) containing DVS spike trains, accumulate them, and save them in a format that can be read by a pyTorch dataset in a faster way.
        - Read the files into a pyTorch dataset
        - Receive frames from the DV software, queue and batch them in order to feed them to a spiking neural network simulation (`LiveDv`).
        
        
        ## Installation
