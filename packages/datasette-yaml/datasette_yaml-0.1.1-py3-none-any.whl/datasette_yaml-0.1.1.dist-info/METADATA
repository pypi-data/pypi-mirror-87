Export Datasette records as YAML

## Installation

Install this plugin in the same environment as Datasette.

    $ datasette install datasette-yaml

## Usage

Having installed this plugin, every table and query will gain a new `.yaml` export link.

You can also construct these URLs directly: `/dbname/tablename.yaml`

## Demo

The plugin is running on [covid-19.datasettes.com](https://covid-19.datasettes.co/) - for example [/covid/latest_ny_times_counties_with_populations.yaml](https://covid-19.datasettes.com/covid/latest_ny_times_counties_with_populations.yaml)

## Development

To set up this plugin locally, first checkout the code. Then create a new virtual environment:

    cd datasette-yaml
    python3 -mvenv venv
    source venv/bin/activate

Or if you are using `pipenv`:

    pipenv shell

Now install the dependencies and tests:

    pip install -e '.[test]'

To run the tests:

    pytest
