Description: # Compare FreeBSD pkg files by metadata
        
        **pkgdiff** is a plugin for the FreeBSD package manager
        [pkg](https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?pkg(7)) as well as a Python
        extension for comparing package files by their metadata.
        
        To that end it uses libpkg (distributed along with the **pkg**
        commandline tools), to open and parse package files and either a basic
        string compare or a line-by-line diff algorithm to complare the
        metadata fields.
        
        How to install

        The Python extension is easily installed by running:
        
        ```bash
        pip install pkgdiff
        ```
        
        Basic usage
        -----------
        
        ```python
        import pkgdiff
        
        if pkgdiff.compare('pkg-1.14.5.txz', 'pkg-1.14.6.txz', exclude=['version']):
            print('packages are equal (ignoring version)')
        ```
