    """
        Calculate the gravimetric capacitance from every cycle of CV scans and output a list of calculated capacitance (F g^-1) for all cycles.
        
        Notes
        -----
        UNITS: current(mA), voltage (V), scan rate (mV/s), mass of the electrodes (mg), and capacitance (F g^-1). 
        The scan rate (mV/s) will be directly read from the filename (i.e. the fielname has to include the current followed by '_mvs' and seperated by '_', '/' or it is the first component of the filename).
        
        Parameters
        ----------
        pathway : :class:`str`
            The path in which the data files are located. 
            The scan rate of each file has to be specified and seperated by either '/' or '_' and followed by '_mvs' at the end, otherwise the scan rate needs to be input as scan_r
            Example: './CV_folder/1_mvs_0.8_V_CV.txt'

        m1 : :class:`float`
            The mass of electrode 1 of the supercapacitor. The mass is in mg.

        m2 : :class:`float`
            The mass of electrode 2 of the supercapacitor. The mass is in mg.

        scan_r : :class:`float`, optional
            The scan rate for the CV measurement in mV/s. If scan_r = False, the program will attempt to extract the scan rate from the file name, given that the scan rate is seperated from other elements of the filename and/or seperated by '_' and/or '/' and that it ends with '_mvs'.
            
        row_skip : :class:`int`, optional
            The number of rows of headers to skip in the text files.
            row_skip = False (row_skip = 1)
                     = : :class:`int` (The specified number of rows will be skipped for all files in the path)
                     
        x_name : :class:`int`/`str`, optional
            Specify the coloumn index for the voltage(V) data, coloumn 0 being the first coloumn starting from the left
            x_name = False (t_set = 0)
                    True (The prompt will ask for the column index to be entered)
                    : :class: `int` (specify the coloumn which will be used as current)
        
        y_name : :class:`int`/`str`, optional
            Specify the coloumn index for the current(mA) data, coloumn 0 being the first coloumn starting from the left
            y_name = False (V_set = 0)
                    True (The prompt will ask for the column index to be entered)
                    : :class: `int` (specify the coloumn which will be used as voltage)
                    
        delimiter : :class:`str`, optional
            The symbol which seperates one data coloumn from the other. If delimiter = False, the delimiter is assumed to be space ''.
        
        int_method : :class:`int`, optional
            The method for integration for the enclosed area.
            int_method = False or 1 (Integration using the trapezoidal rule, discharging curve only)
                       = 102 (Integration using the trapezoidal rule, charging and discharging)
                       = 2 (Integration using the Simpson's rule, discharging curve only)
                       = 202 (Integration using the Simpson's rule, charging and discharging)

        -------
