    Segments structures in images based on a second derivative image
    features.

    IMPORTANT The SegmentationLevelSetImageFilter class and the
    LaplacianSegmentationLevelSetFunction class contain additional
    information necessary to the full understanding of how to use this
    filter. OVERVIEW This class is a level set method segmentation filter.
    It constructs a speed function which is zero at image edges as
    detected by a Laplacian filter. The evolving level set front will
    therefore tend to lock onto zero crossings in the image. The level set
    front moves fastest near edges.

    The Laplacian segmentation filter is intended primarily as a tool for
    refining existing segmentations. The initial isosurface (as given in
    the seed input image) should ideally be very close to the segmentation
    boundary of interest. The idea is that a rough segmentation can be
    refined by allowing the isosurface to deform slightly to achieve a
    better fit to the edge features of an image. One example of such an
    application is to refine the output of a hand segmented image.

    Because values in the Laplacian feature image will tend to be low
    except near edge features, this filter is not effective for segmenting
    large image regions from small seed surfaces. INPUTS This filter
    requires two inputs. The first input is a seed image. This seed image
    must contain an isosurface that you want to use as the seed for your
    segmentation. It can be a binary, graylevel, or floating point image.
    The only requirement is that it contain a closed isosurface that you
    will identify as the seed by setting the IsosurfaceValue parameter of
    the filter. For a binary image you will want to set your isosurface
    value halfway between your on and off values (i.e. for 0's and 1's,
    use an isosurface value of 0.5).

    The second input is the feature image. This is the image from which
    the speed function will be calculated. For most applications, this is
    the image that you want to segment. The desired isosurface in your
    seed image should lie within the region of your feature image that you
    are trying to segment.  Note that this filter does no preprocessing of
    the feature image before thresholding. Because second derivative
    calculations are highly sensitive to noise, isotropic or anisotropic
    smoothing of the feature image can dramatically improve the results.

    See SegmentationLevelSetImageFilter for more information on Inputs.
    OUTPUTS The filter outputs a single, scalar, real-valued image.
    Positive *values in the output image are inside the segmented region
    and negative *values in the image are outside of the inside region.
    The zero crossings of *the image correspond to the position of the
    level set front.

        Create a new object of the class itkLaplacianSegmentationLevelSetImageFilterIF3IF3F and set the input and the parameters if some
        named or non-named arguments are passed to that method.

        New() tries to assign all the non named parameters to the input of the new objects - the
        first non named parameter in the first input, etc.

        The named parameters are used by calling the method with the same name prefixed by 'Set'.
