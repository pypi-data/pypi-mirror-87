Description: # Classroom Voter
        Classroom Voter is a secure LAN based polling system, similar to iClicker, which allows teachers to administer live polls. To start a poll, the teacher simply has to run the host program on their local machine. To join, students run the client program and enter the teachers IP address. Students can respond to questions via clients on their machines. 
        
        Traffic is sent over HTTP on the local network. The system provides instructors with the ability to take polls while providing controllable levels of anonymity for students. For example, a teacher might make one question anonymized so that their view of the poll results just shows the number of students who voted for each option. Another poll might be transparent, and the instructor can see which participant voted for which option.
