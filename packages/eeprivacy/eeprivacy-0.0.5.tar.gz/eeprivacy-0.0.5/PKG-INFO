        =========
        
        This repository contains the pilot implementation of the core privacy methods for Energy Differential Privacy (EDP). The key components are:
        
        * Core Differential Privacy for energy efficiency analytics (`eeprivacy`)
        * Python API documentation for `eeprivacy`
        * Sample implementations of key use cases
        
        [Examples and library documentation](https://openeemeter.github.io/eeprivacy/)
