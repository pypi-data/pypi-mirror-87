        *Marabunta is a name given to the migration of the legionary ants or to the ants
        themselves. Restless, they eat and digest everything in their way.*
        
        Marabunta is used to provide an easy way to create Updates for Odoo fast and run easily. It also allows to differentiate between different environment to provide for instance demodata.
        
        
        Usage
        =====
        After installing marabunta, it will be available as a console command. To run properly it requires a migration file (which defines what has to updated/executed) and odoos connection parameters (view options in the options section.
        
        At each run marabunta verifies the versions from the migration file and and processes new ones.
        It is very much recommended to configure it, so that marabunta is ran automatically if odoo is started.
        For instance adding it to your docker entrypoint.
        
        Features
        ========
        
        * backup: Marabunta allows for a backup command to be executed before the migration.
        * addon upgrades: Marabunta is able to install or upgrade odoo addons.
        * operations: Allows to execute commands before or after upgrading modules.
        * modes: Modes allow the user to execute commands only on a certain environment. e.g. creation of demodata on a dev system.
        * maintenance page: publish an html page during the migration.
        
        Versioning systems
        ------------------
        Currently Marabunta allows for two different Versioning systems:
        The classic Major.Minor.Bugfix and the Five digits long versions for OdooMajor.OdooMinor.Major.Minor.Bugfix.
        Although the first marabunta version must be **setup** for the initial setup of your instance. (Find out more about the rationale here <https://github.com/camptocamp/marabunta/commit/9b96acaff8e7eecbf82ff592b7bb927b4cd82f02>)

        YAML layout & Example
        =====================
        Here is an Example migration file::
        
            migration:
              options:
                # This includes general options which are used everytime marabunta is called.
                # --workers=0 --stop-after-init are automatically added
                install_command: odoo #Command which starts odoo
                install_args: --log-level=debug # additional Arguments
                backup: # Defines how the backup should be done before the migration.
                  command: echo "backup command on ${DB_NAME}"
                  stop_on_failure: true
                  ignore_if: test "${RUNNING_ENV}" != "prod"
              versions:
                - version: setup # Setup is always the initia. version<
                  operations:
                    pre:  # executed before 'addons'
                      - echo 'pre-operation'
                    post:  # executed after 'addons'
                      - anthem songs::install
                  addons:
                    upgrade:  # executed as odoo --stop-after-init -i/-u ...
                      - base
                      - document
                  modes:
                    prod:
                      operations:
                        pre:
                          - echo 'pre-operation executed only when the mode is prod'
                        post:

                    demo:
                      operations:
                        post:
                          - anthem songs::load_demo_data
                      addons:
                        upgrade:
                          - demo_addon
        
                - version: 0.0.2
                  backup: false
                  # nothing to do this can be used to keep marabunta and gittag in sync
        
                - version: 0.0.3
                  operations:
                    pre: # we also can execute os commands
                      - echo 'foobar'
                      - ls
                      - bin/script_test.sh
                    post:
                      - echo 'post-op'
        
                - version: 0.0.4
                  backup: false
                  addons:
                    upgrade:
                      - popeye
        
        
        Run the tests
        -------------
        
        To run ``marabunta`` tests, it is a good idea to do an *editable*
        install of it in a virtualenv, and then intall and run ``pytest`` as
        follows::
        
          $ git clone https://github.com/camptocamp/marabunta.git
          Cloning into 'marabunta'...
          $ cd marabunta
          $ virtualenv -p YOUR_PYTHON env
          $ source env/bin/activate
          $ pip install '.[test]'
          $ py.test tests

        **Build**
        
        * The lib is now automaticaly published to Pypi by Travis when a tag is added

        +++++++++++++++++++
        
        **Backward incompatible change**
        
        * In the migration yaml file, the ``command`` and ``command_args`` options are
          now all merged into ``command``
        
        **Features**
        
        * Backup command and backup's ignore_if are now run in a 'sh' shell so we can
          inject environment variables in the commands
        * Backup command can now use ``$database``, ``$db_host``, ``$db_port``,
          ``$db_user``, ``$db_password`` that will be substituted by the current
          configuration values
        
        **Bugfixes**
        
        * When starting 2 concurrent marabunta process and the first fail, it releases
          the lock and the second would start odoo without actually run the migration.
          Now, when the migration lock is released, the other process(es) will recheck
          all versions as well before running odoo.
        
        **Documentation**
        
        * Add some high-level documentation
        
        
        0.9.0 (2018-09-04)
        ++++++++++++++++++
        
        **Features**
        
        
        * 1st version it's always "setup"
        
          In all projects' usecases the 1st version is always to setup the initial state.
          Adopting `setup` as the 1st version makes also easier to squash intermediate version
          all in one as the project and its releases grow up.
        
        * Support 5 digits version
        
          Now you can use 5 digits versions as per odoo modules.
          For instance: `11.0.3.0.1`. This give us better numbering for patches
          and makes versionig withing Odoo world more consistent.
          Old 3 digits versions are still supported for backward compat.
        
        Full rationale for above changes available here
        
        https://github.com/camptocamp/marabunta/commit/9b96acaff8e7eecbf82ff592b7bb927b4cd82f02
        
        * Backup option
        
          Migration allows using a `backup` command in order to perform specific
          commands (unless explicitly opted-out) before the migration step.
        
          No backup machinery provided as you are suppose to run your own command
          to execute the backup.
        
        
        **Bugfixes**
        
        * Build Py3 wheel on release
        
        
        0.8.0 (2017-11-16)
        ++++++++++++++++++
        
        Python3!
        
        0.7.3 (2017-11-01)
        ++++++++++++++++++
        
        **Bugfixes**
        
        * Support special chars (such as +) in Postgres passwords. The passwords were
          incorrectly passed through unquote_plus, which transform the + char to a
          space.
        
        0.7.2 (2017-09-15)
        ++++++++++++++++++
        
        **Bugfixes**
        
        * Use --no-xmlrpc option when running odoo as the new web server use the same port,
          it's not needed anyway
        
        0.7.1 (2017-09-11)
        ++++++++++++++++++
        
        **Bugfixes**
        
        * Include maintenance html file in the distribution
        
        
        0.7.0 (2017-09-08)
        ++++++++++++++++++
        
        **Features**
        
        * Publish a maintenance web page during migration. The host and port are
          configurable with new options. By default the port match odoo's (8069). A
          default maintenance is provided, but it can be configured as well.
        * When a migration fails, the log alongside the traceback are logged in the
          ``marabunta_version`` table.
        
        **Bugfixes**
        
        * Commands with unicode chars make the migration fail
        
        **Build**
        
        * Removed python3 from tox, it doesn't run on py3 and we can't make them run
          now. Odoo is still python2, py3 compat will come when it'll switch.
        
        
        0.6.3 (2016-12-12)
        ++++++++++++++++++
        
        
        **Bugfixes**
        
        * The new connection opened in 0.6.2 might suffer from the same issue of
          timeout than before 0.6.0: the connection is long-lived but there is no
          keep-alive for this connection. Open a new connection for each update in
          marabunta_version, which might be spaced between long subprocess operations
        
        
        0.6.2 (2016-12-12)
        ++++++++++++++++++
        
        **Bugfixes**
        
        * Autocommit the operations done in the marabunta_version table.  Previously,
          after an exception, the changes to marabunta_version were rollbacked, which
          is not the expected behavior (it makes the migration restart ceaseless).
          As a side effect, Marabunta now opens 2 connections. The connection opened
          for the adsivory lock cannot commit before the end because it would release
          the lock.
        
        
        0.6.1 (2016-11-25)
        ++++++++++++++++++
        
        Important bugfix! The changes in the ``marabunta_version`` were never
        committed, so migration would run again.
        
        **Bugfixes**
        
        * Commit the connection so changes are not rollbacked.
        
        0.6.0 (2016-11-21)
        ++++++++++++++++++
        
        **Improvements**
        
        * Rework of the database connections:
        
          * The advisory lock is opened in a cursor in a thread, this cursor
            periodically executes a dummy 'SELECT 1' to be sure that the connection
            stay alive (not killed with a timeout) when a long-running subprocess is
            run.
          * The operations in database are executed in short-lived cursors. This
            prevents an issue we had when the open cursor was locking
            'ir_module_module', preventing odoo to install/update properly.
        
        * Try to disable colors in output if the term does not support colors
        
        
        0.5.1 (2016-10-26)
        ++++++++++++++++++
        
        * Fix: marabunta processes run concurrently all tried to run the migration,
          this is better handled with a PostgreSQL advisory lock now
        
        
        0.5.0 (2016-10-12)
        ++++++++++++++++++
        
        Odoo 10 Support
        
        **Features**
        
        - Switch the default command line for running odoo to ``odoo`` instead of
          ``odoo.py`` (renamed in Odoo 10). For usage with previous version, you must
          specify the ``install_command`` in the ``migration.yml`` file.
        
        
        0.4.2 (2016-08-17)
        ++++++++++++++++++
        
        **Bugfixes**
        
        - Prevent error (25, 'Inappropriate ioctl for device') when
          stdout is not a tty by disabling the interactive mode.
        
        
        0.4.1 (2016-07-27)
        ++++++++++++++++++
        
        **Bugfixes**
        
        - Do not print on stdout the result of operations twice
        
        
        0.4.0 (2016-07-26)
        ++++++++++++++++++
        
        **Improvements**
        
        - New dependency on ``pexpect``. Used to create a pseudo-tty to execute the
          operations.  It enables line buffering and interactivity for pdb in the
          children processes.
        
        **Fixes**
        
        - Noop operations are really considered as such
        
        
        0.3.3 (2016-07-12)
        ++++++++++++++++++
        
        **Fixes**
        
        - Encode print's outputs to the stdout's encoding or to utf8 by default
        
        0.3.2 (2016-07-08)
        ++++++++++++++++++
        
        **Fixes**
        
        - Failure when there are no version to process
        
        0.3.1 (2016-07-07)
        ++++++++++++++++++
        
        **Fixes**
        
        - Fix decoding issues with output of subprocesses
        
        0.3.0 (2016-07-06)
        ++++++++++++++++++
        
        Introducing **modes**.
        
        **Backward incompatible changes**
        
        - ``--demo`` is replaced by a more general ``--mode`` argument,
          the equivalent being ``--mode=demo``
        - ``MARABUNTA_DEMO`` is replaced by ``MARABUNTA_MODE``
        - the configuration file has now operations and addons by "modes", allowing to
          load some different scripts or install different addons for different modes
          (the addons list are merged and the operations of the modes are executed
          after the main ones)::
        
            - version: 0.0.1
              operations:
                pre:  # executed before 'addons'
                  - echo 'pre-operation'
                post:  # executed after 'addons'
                  - anthem songs::install
              addons:
                upgrade:
                  - base
              modes:
                prod:
                  operations:
                    pre:
                      - echo 'pre-operation executed only when the mode is prod'
                    post:
                      - anthem songs::load_production_data
                demo:
                  operations:
                    post:
                      - anthem songs::load_demo_data
                  addons:
                    upgrade:
                      - demo_addon
        
        - ``--force`` renamed to ``--allow-serie``
        - ``MARABUNTA_FORCE`` renamed to ``MARABUNTA_ALLOW_SERIE``
        - ``--project-file`` renamed to ``--migration-file``
        - ``MARABUNTA_PROJECT_FILE`` renamed to ``MARABUNTA_MIGRATION_FILE``
        
        **Improvements**
        
        - When 'allow_serie' is used, the same Odoo addon will not be
          upgraded more than one time when it is in the 'upgrade' section of
          more than one version
        
        **Fixes**
        
        - Fix error when there is no db version in the database
        - Fix error ``AttributeError: 'bool' object has no attribute 'number'``
          when there is an unfinished version
        - Fix error when the db version is above the unprocessed version
        
        0.2.2 (2016-06-23)
        ++++++++++++++++++
        
        **Improvements**
        
        - Adapted the README so that it is rendered as ReST on pypi.
        
        0.2.1 (2016-06-23)
        ++++++++++++++++++
        
        **Bugfixes**
        
        - Fixed the version information of the package and release date.
        
        0.2.0 (2016-06-23)
        ++++++++++++++++++
        
        **Features**
        
        - Added support for Python 3.4 and 3.5 in addition to 2.7.
        
        **Bugfixes**
        
        - Fixed a crash with empty install args
        
        **Improvements**
        
        - Use YAML ``safe_load`` for added security.
        
        **Documentation**
        
        - Bootstrapped the Sphinx documentation.
        
        **Build**
        
        - Switched to tox for the build. This allow to run the same tests in all
          environment locally like in travis. The travis configuration just calls tox
          now.
        - Added runtime dependencies to the package, kept separate from the build and test dependencies (installed separately by tox).
        
        0.1.1 (2016-06-08)
        ++++++++++++++++++
        
        - Fixed problems with packaging so that now marabunta can be installable from
          pypi.

        ++++++++++++++++++
        
        Initial release. This corresponds to the initial work of Guewen Baconnier.
