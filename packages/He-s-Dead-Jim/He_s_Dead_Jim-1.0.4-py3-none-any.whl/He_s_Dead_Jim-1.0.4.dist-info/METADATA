## He's Dead, Jim (Release 0.1)

#### Scope

For our first project we are tasked with building a command-line tool for finding and reporting dead links (e.g., broken URLs) in a file. Users might use the tool to help locate broken URLs in an HTML page, for example. The tool can be written in any programming language.

#### How It Works

He's Dead, Jim aggregates (a fancy word for saying _grabs_) all href tags on a single page/file and creates get requests for each link on the page. Those requests are then reported back to the user along with the status code and a delightful colour coded message indicating the status of each link.

#### Optional Features

He's Dead Jim features the following optional features:

- Colourized output. Good URLs are printed in green, bad URLs are printed in red, and unknown URLs in gray.
- -v can be supplied to the program for current version information.
- Program incorporates multi-threading to allow for parallelization of the program.

#### Usage

Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) on your machine and reboot. Then:

> git clone https://github.com/chrispinkney/He-s-Dead-Jim.git

> cd He-s-Dead-Jim

> pip install -r requirements.txt

> python src/hdj.py
