===============================
ckill - Cleanly kills a process
===============================

Utility that allows to safely and cleanly terminate a multiprocess application
that implements a shutdown, clean-up, or exit routine when a SIGTERM is
received.

ckill sends a SIGTERM signal to the main process, waits for it to die, and if
it doesn't after some timeout, SIGKILL all its subprocesses in the process tree
from higher (recent) to lower (former) PID value.

In this way, ckill allows the process to terminate correctly, but if it
malfunctions when terminating, or if it takes too much time (determined by the
user) all its subprocesses are killed and then the main process itself, leaving
no zombie processes behind.
