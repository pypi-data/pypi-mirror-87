Description: # checkThatLink
        
        This is a CLI tool used to check an html file for the status of the URL's it contains.
        
        The application requires the path to a file as it's first positional argument.
        
        ```$  checkThatLink.py [fileName]```
        
        The status of the URL will be shown by colour
          - Green = good link
          - Cyan = secured link
          - Red = bad link
          - Grey = unknown link
          
        ### Options
        
        You can also use the optional flag argument -s or --secureHttp to indicate that you want to see if the supplied http URL's
        will work using https instead.
        
        ``` $  checkThatLink.py [fileName] -s```
        
        You can choose to have the output be in JSON format instead of the original output by using the -j or --json flags.
        
        ``` $  checkThatLink.py [fileName] -j```
        
        There is also the option to get only good, or bad matches with the corresponding flags: 
        
        ``` $  checkThatLink.py [fileName] --good OR --bad```
        
        The optional flag argument -i or --ignore with a filepath will load and parse an ignored URLs text file.
        
        ``` $  checkThatLink.py [fileName] -i [ignoreFile]```
        
        The format of an ignored URLs text file is as follows:
        - URLs must be placed on separate lines and begin with either `http` or `https`
        - Any line that begins with `#` is a comment and will not be parsed
        
        To check the status of the 10 latest Telescope posts you can use the -t --telescope optional argument.
        Doing so will ignore the file given and instead check Telescope.
        
        *You must have Telescope's backend running locally in order to use this feature*
        
        ``` $  checkThatLink.py [fileName] -t```
