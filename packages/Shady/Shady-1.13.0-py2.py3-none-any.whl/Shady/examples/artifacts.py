#: Geometric transformations can lead to interpolation artifacts
"""
This demo illustrates the artifacts that may be
created (especially in unlinearized stimuli) when a
texture stimulus is rotated, scaled or translated by
an amount that has not been appropriately rounded.

See `Shady.Documentation.PreciseControlOfLuminance`
for a section that describes when such artifacts
can occur and how to avoid them.

	Now let's make the stimuli on the left rotate very slightly
