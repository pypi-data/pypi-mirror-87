Several image\nhosts are supported, to which one can directly upload images or rehost images\nby URL.\n\n## Usage\n\nBasic image uploading can be done via the `bubblegum upload` command. To upload\na local image file, run `bubblegum upload /path/to/image.png`. To rehost a URL,\nrun `bubblegum upload https://this.url.serves.an/image.png`.\n\nThe default image host is https://vgy.me, as it does not require client\nauthorization. The image host that will be used can be changed with the\n`--host` flag in the upload command, e.g. `bubblegum upload --host=imgur.com\n/path/to/image.png`. The default image host can also be changed in the config\nfile. Host options can be viewed with the `bubblegum upload --help` command.\n\nUploading/rehosting multiple images simultaneously is also supported, via\nmultiple arguments to the `upload` command. `bubblegum upload a.jpg b.png` will\nupload both images simultaneously. By default, 4 workers are spawned for image\nuploading. The number of workers can be increased or decreased in the config.\n\nA history of uploaded images can be viewed with `bubblegum history`. The\noutputted list can be manipulated with the `--sort`, `--limit` and `--offset`\noptions.\n\n### Config\n\nThe configuration can be edited with the `bubblegum config` command. A default\nconfiguration file is created when the script first runs.\n\n#### Image Host Profiles\n\nbubblegum includes loaded profiles for the following two hosts by default:\n\n- `imgur.com` (https://imgur.com)\n- `vgy.me` (https://vgy.me)\n\nOther image host profiles can be found in the `extra_profiles/` directory.\n\nImage host profiles can be created/added to the application by adding a profile\ndictionary to the list of `profiles` in your config file. Each profile must\ncontain 8 key/value pairs:\n\n- `image_host_name` - The name of the image host, for use with the `--host=`\n  option.\n- `image_host_url` - The URL of the host's image uploading endpoint.\n- `request_headers` - Extra headers to include in the upload request.\n- `upload_form_file_argument` - The name of the key for the image file in the\n  form.\n- `upload_form_data_argument` - A dictionary sent as the form data in a file\n  upload.\n- `rehost_form_url_argument` - If the host supports URL rehosting, the name of\n  the key for the URL in the form. Otherwise, set it to `null`.\n- `rehost_form_data_argument` - A dictionary sent as the form data in a URL\n  rehost.\n- `json_response` - A boolean indicating whether or not the returned data is\n  JSON or not. If True, the `data response` variable will be the deserialized\n  JSON. If False, the `data` request response variable will be the response\n  text.\n- `image_url_template` - A string of an f-string (yeah, sounds confusing) for\n  the image URL. Can access the request response via the `data` variable.\n- `deletion_url_template` - A string of an f-string for the deletion URL. Can\n  access the request response via the `data` variable.\n\n### Imgur\n\nTo upload to imgur, a Client ID must be created and supplied. Details on\ncreating a Client ID can be found at\nhttps://apidocs.imgur.com/#authorization-and-oauth. Once created, the Client ID\ncan be added to the config, as the `imgur_client_id`.\n",
