If you use iminuit for work/research presented in a publication, we would be happy if you mention us in the acknowledgments, like so:

This research made use of the MINUIT algorithm\cite{1975CoPhC..10..343J} via the iminuit\cite{iminuit} Python library.

You can get a BibTeX entry for the version that you used from Zenodo. Go to https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3949207, select the appropriate version, and click on "BibTex" in the Export box on the bottom right. You will get an entry like this:
