Description: # PythonPals
        
        ## Usage
        `This project is a game intended to teach new programmers basic concepts of the Python language in an
        engaging, 2D battle. Players will choose which concepts they would like to review (e.g. syntax, logic,
        number conversion) and then enter a battle scene where they will be asked multiple-choice questions and
        be expected to provide the correct answer. A correct answer deals damage to the opponent while an
        incorrect answer reduces the player's own HP. The player wins when their opponent's HP reaches zero and
        the player loses if their own HP reaches zero. The production release now also includes the option to change the 
        questions to History and Geography categories as well as multiple levels and sound effects for feedback.
