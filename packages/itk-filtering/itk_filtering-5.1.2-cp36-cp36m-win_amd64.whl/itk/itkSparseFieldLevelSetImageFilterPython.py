    This class implements a finite difference partial differential
    equation solver for evolving surfaces embedded in volumes as level-
    sets.

    The "sparse field" approach to the level-set model is a logical
    extension of the classical narrow band technique, which seeks to
    minimize computational effort by restricting calculations to those
    pixels in a region of interest around the moving surface (the
    $k$-level curve). The sparse field method uses a narrow band that is
    exactly the width needed to calculate changes on the level curve for
    the next time step. Because the band of grid points under
    consideration is so sparse, this approach has several advantages: the
    algorithm does exactly the number of calculations needed to determine
    the next position of the $k$-level curve, and the distance transform
    around the level curve can be recomputed at each iteration.

    The sparse field algorithm works by constructing a linked list of
    indices that are adjacent to the $k$-level set. These indices are
    called the "active set". The values at these active set indices
    define the position of the $k$-level curve. The active set indices are
    shifted to follow the distance transform embedding of the $k$-level
    curve as their values move in and out of a fixed numerical range about
    $k$. In this way, the active set is maintained as only those pixels
    adjacent to the evolving surface. Calculations are then done only at
    indices contained in the active set.

    The city-block neighborhoods of the active set indices are maintained
    as separate lists called "layers". At each iteration, the values at
    the layers are reinitialized as the distance transform from the active
    set. The number of layers can be adjusted according to the footprint
    needed for the calculations on the level curve.

    Briefly, the sparse field solver algorithm is as follows:

    For each active layer index $x_j$: Compute the change at $u_{x_j}$,
    the grid point in the embedding, based on local geometry and external
    forces and using a stable numerical scheme.

    For each active layer index $x_j$, add the change to the grid point
    value and redefine the active set indices and those of its layers
    based on any value changes which have moved outside of the numerical
    range allowed for the active set.

    Starting with the first layers adjacent to the active set and moving
    outwards, reconstruct the distance transform by setting values in the
    layers according to their neighbors. At the very outer layers, add or
    remove indices which have come into or moved out of the sparse field.

    HOW TO USE THIS CLASS Typically, this class should be subclassed with
    additional functionality for specific applications. It is possible,
    however to use this solver as a filter directly by instantiating it
    and supplying it with an appropriate LevelSetFunction object via the
    SetDifferenceFunction method. See the subclasses and their associated
    documentation for more information on using this class. Also see the
    FiniteDifferenceImageFilter documentation for a general overview of
    this class of solvers. INPUTS This filter takes an itk::Image as
    input. The appropriate type of input image is entirely determined by
    the application. As a rule, however, the input type is immediately
    converted to the output type before processing. This is because the
    input is not assumed to be a real value type and must be converted to
    signed, real values for the calculations. The input values will also
    be shifted by the $k$ isosurface value so that the algorithm only
    needs to consider the zero level set. OUTPUTS The output of the filter
    is the distance transform embedding of the isosurface as the zero
    level set. Values INSIDE the surface will be NEGATIVE and values
    OUTSIDE the surface will be POSITIVE. The distance transform only
    holds for those indices in layers around the active layer. Elsewhere,
    the values are a fixed positive or negative that is one greater than
    the layer of greatest magnitude. In other words, if there are three
    layers, then inside values reach a minimum of -4.0 and outside values
    a maximum of 4.0. PARAMETERS The NumberOfLayers parameter controls the
    number of layers inside and outside of the active set (see description
    above). The sparse field will contain 2*NumberOfLayers+1 lists of
    indices: the active set and city block neighbors inside and outside
    the active set. It is important to specify enough layers to cover the
    footprint of your calculations. Curvature calculations require a
    minimum of 2 layers. Higher order derivatives and other geometrical
    measures may require more layers. If too few layers are specified,
    then the calculations will pull values from the background, which may
    consist of arbitrary or random values.

    The IsoSurfaceValue indicates which value in the input represents the
    interface of interest. By default, this value is zero. When the solver
    initializes, it will subtract the IsoSurfaceValue from all values, in
    the input, shifting the isosurface of interest to zero in the output.
    IMPORTANT! Read the documentation for FiniteDifferenceImageFilter
    before attempting to use this filter. The solver requires that you
    specify a FiniteDifferenceFunction to use for calculations. This is
    set using the method SetDifferenceFunction in the parent class.

    input is not assumed to be a real value type and must be converted to
    signed, real values for the calculations. The input values will also
    be shifted by the $k$ isosurface value so that the algorithm only
    needs to consider the zero level set. OUTPUTS The output of the filter
    is the distance transform embedding of the isosurface as the zero
    level set. Values INSIDE the surface will be NEGATIVE and values
    OUTSIDE the surface will be POSITIVE. The distance transform only
    holds for those indices in layers around the active layer. Elsewhere,
    the values are a fixed positive or negative that is one greater than
    the layer of greatest magnitude. In other words, if there are three
    layers, then inside values reach a minimum of -4.0 and outside values
    a maximum of 4.0. PARAMETERS The NumberOfLayers parameter controls the
    number of layers inside and outside of the active set (see description
    above). The sparse field will contain 2*NumberOfLayers+1 lists of
    indices: the active set and city block neighbors inside and outside
    the active set. It is important to specify enough layers to cover the
    footprint of your calculations. Curvature calculations require a
    minimum of 2 layers. Higher order derivatives and other geometrical
    measures may require more layers. If too few layers are specified,
    then the calculations will pull values from the background, which may
    consist of arbitrary or random values.

    The IsoSurfaceValue indicates which value in the input represents the
    interface of interest. By default, this value is zero. When the solver
    initializes, it will subtract the IsoSurfaceValue from all values, in
    the input, shifting the isosurface of interest to zero in the output.

    This class implements a finite difference partial differential
    equation solver for evolving surfaces embedded in volumes as level-
    sets.

    The "sparse field" approach to the level-set model is a logical
    extension of the classical narrow band technique, which seeks to
    minimize computational effort by restricting calculations to those
    pixels in a region of interest around the moving surface (the
    $k$-level curve). The sparse field method uses a narrow band that is
    exactly the width needed to calculate changes on the level curve for
    the next time step. Because the band of grid points under
    consideration is so sparse, this approach has several advantages: the
    algorithm does exactly the number of calculations needed to determine
    the next position of the $k$-level curve, and the distance transform
    around the level curve can be recomputed at each iteration.

    The sparse field algorithm works by constructing a linked list of
    indices that are adjacent to the $k$-level set. These indices are
    called the "active set". The values at these active set indices
    define the position of the $k$-level curve. The active set indices are
    shifted to follow the distance transform embedding of the $k$-level
    curve as their values move in and out of a fixed numerical range about
    $k$. In this way, the active set is maintained as only those pixels
    adjacent to the evolving surface. Calculations are then done only at
    indices contained in the active set.

    The city-block neighborhoods of the active set indices are maintained
    as separate lists called "layers". At each iteration, the values at
    the layers are reinitialized as the distance transform from the active
    set. The number of layers can be adjusted according to the footprint
    needed for the calculations on the level curve.

    Briefly, the sparse field solver algorithm is as follows:

    For each active layer index $x_j$: Compute the change at $u_{x_j}$,
    the grid point in the embedding, based on local geometry and external
    forces and using a stable numerical scheme.

    For each active layer index $x_j$, add the change to the grid point
    value and redefine the active set indices and those of its layers
    based on any value changes which have moved outside of the numerical
    range allowed for the active set.

    Starting with the first layers adjacent to the active set and moving
    outwards, reconstruct the distance transform by setting values in the
    layers according to their neighbors. At the very outer layers, add or
    remove indices which have come into or moved out of the sparse field.
