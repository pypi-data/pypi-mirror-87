#--  Introduction  --#
######################
adcc and the adcc source code is released under the terms of the GNU General Public
 License Version 3 (GPLv3). This terms of release, however, do not apply to the
adccore binary file `libadccore.so` (or a simlilarly named dylib file for MacOS),
contained in the `adcc/lib` directory of the python code tarball or the python
package directory.

This measure was taken, since adccore integrates dependencies, where the
licence terms only permit a public release in the form of a precompiled binary.
The precise terms, which apply to the binary library blob adcc/lib/libadccore.so
or adcc/lib/libadccore.dylib can be found in the next sections of this file.
A list of components compiled into libadccore is given in the last section.
