.. code-block:: python

    ids_from_server(index="appevents",
                    time_range=('2018-01-01T00:00:00.000', '2030-01-01T00:00:00.000')) -> dict:

Extracts IDs from the server that have logged _something_ in the given time range, in the given index. Returns them as a dictionary (keys: IDs, values: doc_counts).
