# Python Signal Processing

Signal processing can be daunting; this repo contains tutorials on understanding and applying signal processing using NumPy and PyTorch.

**splearn** is a package for signal processing and machine learning with Python. It is built on top of [NumPy](https://numpy.org) and [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org), to provide easy to use functions from common signal processing tasks to machine learning.

## Tutorials

We aim to bridge the gap for anyone who are new signal processings to get started, check out the [tutorials](https://github.com/jinglescode/python-signal-processing/tree/master/tutorials) to get started on signal processings.

### 1. Signal composition (time, sampling rate and frequency)

In order to begin the signal processing adventure, we need to understand what we are dealing with. In the first tutorial, we will uncover what is a signal, and what it is made up of. We will look at how the sampling rate and frequency can affect a signal. We will also see what happens when we combine multiple signals of different frequencies.

### 2. Fourier Transform

In the first tutorial, we learned that combining multiple signals will produce a new signal where all the frequencies are jumbled up. In this tutorial, we will learn about Fourier Transform and how it can take a complex signal and decompose it to the frequencies that made it up.

### 3. Denoising with mean-smooth filter

How can we apply the simplest filter to perform denoising? Introduce the running mean filter; we can remove noise that is normally distributed relative to the signal of interest.

## Getting Started

### Installation

Currently, this has not been released. Use Git or checkout with SVN, and install the dependencies:

```
git clone https://github.com/jinglescode/python-signal-processing.git
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Dependencies

See [requirements.txt](https://github.com/jinglescode/python-signal-processing/tree/master/requirements.txt).

### Usage

Let's generate a 2D-signal, sampled at 100-Hz. Design and apply a 4th-order bandpass Butterworth filter with a cutoff frequency between 5-Hz and 20-Hz.

```python
from splearn.data.generate import signal
from splearn.filter.butter import butter_bandpass

signal_2d = signal(
    length_seconds=4, 
    sampling_rate=100, 
    frequencies=[[4,7,11,17,40, 50],[1, 3]],
    plot=True
)

signal_2d_filtered = butter_bandpass(
    signal=signal_2d, 
    lowcut=5, 
    highcut=20, 
    sample_rate=100,
    type='sos',
    order=4, 
    plot=True,
    plot_xlim=[3,20]
)
```
