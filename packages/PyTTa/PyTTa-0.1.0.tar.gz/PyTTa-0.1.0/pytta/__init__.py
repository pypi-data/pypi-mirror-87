"""
This is a package developed to perform acoustic and vibration measurements
and signal analysis.

To get started, try:

    >>> import pytta

    >>> pytta.default()
    >>> pytta.list_devices()

    >>> mySignal = pytta.generate.sweep()
    >>> mySignal.plot_freq()  # same as pytta.plot_freq(mySignal)

Our current dependencies are:

    * Numpy
    * Scipy
    * Matplotlib
    * Numba
    * h5py
    * SoundDevice
    * SoundFile

PyTTa is now a multi-paradigm toolbox, which may change in the future. We aim
from now on to be more Pythonic, and therefore more object-oriented. For now,
we have classes and functions operating together to provide a working
environment for acoustical measurements and post-processing.

The toolbox' structure is presented next.


Sub-packages:
-------------

    * pytta.classes:
        main classes intended to do measurements (Rec, PlayRec and
        FRFMeasurement), handle signals/processed data (SignalObj and
        Analysis), handle streaming functionalities (Monitor and Streaming),
        filter (OctFilter), communicate with some hardware (LJU3EI1050),
        and also intended for new features whose should have an
        object-oriented implementation. The main classes are called from the
        toolbox's top-level (e.g. pytta.SignalObj, pytta.Analysis, ...);

    * pytta.utils:
        contains simple tools which help to keep things modularized and make
        more accessible the reuse of some operations. Intended to hold tools
        (classes and functions) whose operate built-in python classes, NumPy
        arrays, and other stuff not contained by the pytta.classes subpackage;

    * pytta.apps:
        applications built from the toolbox's functionalities. The apps
        are called from the top-level (e.g. pytta.roomir);


Modules:
--------

    * pytta.functions:
        assistant functions intended to manipulate and visualize multiple
        signals and analyses stored as SignalObj and Analysis objects. These
        functions are called from the toolbox's top-level (e.g.
        pytta.plot_time, pytta.plot_waterfall, ...);

    * pytta.generate:
        functions for signal synthesis and measurement configuration;

    * pytta.rooms:
        room acoustics parameters calculation according to ISO 3382-1;

    * pytta.iso3741:
        calculations according to the standard;


You can find usage examples in the toolbox's examples folder.
