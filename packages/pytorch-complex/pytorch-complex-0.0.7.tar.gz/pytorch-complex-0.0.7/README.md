# pytorch-complex

Install it using pip: 

pip install pytorch-complex

Usage:
Similar to PyTorch.
For using the Complex features of this library, just change the regular torch imports with torchcomplex imports.
For example:
import torchcomplex.nn as nn  instead of import torch.nn as nn
Then, simply nn.Conv2d for both torch and torchcomplex, for 2D Convolution
