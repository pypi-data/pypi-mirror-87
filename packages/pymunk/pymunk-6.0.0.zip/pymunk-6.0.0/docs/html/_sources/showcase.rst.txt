        **Winner of PyWeek 24** (Overall Team Entry)
        
        A game of fun, shooting, and "I'm sorry to put you through this".

        A fabricator robot on Mars was supposed to make a bunch of robots! 
        But it got lazy and made robots that could make other robots. And 
        it made them smarter than they should have been. Now they've all 
        gone off and hidden away behind various tanks and computers. 
        
        Happily, he knew how to construct *you*, a simple fighting robot. 
        It's your job to clean out each area!

        Recently I learned Pymunk 2d physics library.
        It is very cool so with that I made 2d Humanoid for my AI.
        Today I'm going to teach AI to move forward with NEAT.
        NEAT is a genetic algorithm for the generation of evolving artificial 
        neural networks.
        Results are quite weird but it will be fun.
        Have fun!

        Among the simplest AI algorithms: Differential Evolution. Brought to 
        life with Pymunk and Pygame. Each car has an objective of reaching the 
        end of the track, but has only 15 seconds to do so. They explore the 
        multidimensional search space of vehicle speed, chassis width, chassis 
        height and wheel radius, to find a variety of configurations among 
        which few are successful in helping the car cross the track.

        VirtuaPlant is a Industrial Control Systems simulator which adds a 
        "similar to real-world control logic" to the basic "read/write tags" 
        feature of most PLC simulators. Paired with a game library and 2d 
        physics engine, VirtuaPlant is able to present a GUI simulating the 
        "world view" behind the control system allowing the user to have a 
        vision of the would-be actions behind the control systems.
