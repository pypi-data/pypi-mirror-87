# `heic-to-jpg` ðŸ“¸

CLI tool for converting `HEIC` images to `jpg`.

Motivation: When transfering images from an iPhone to a Mac via airdrop, they are being transfered as `HEIC`. Oftentime though, another format (such as `jpg`) is required to further make use of those images.

## installation

`pip install heic-to-jpg`

## usage

`heic-to-jpg -s ~/path/to/source [--keep]`
