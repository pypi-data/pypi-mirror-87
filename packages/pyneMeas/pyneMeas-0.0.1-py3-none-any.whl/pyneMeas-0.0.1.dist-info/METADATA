# pyneMeas documentation 

A package for simple electrical measurements using the National Instruments (NI) VISA standard.
Developed by Jakob Seidl and coworkers at the Nanoelectronics group at the University of New South Wales, Sydney.
It was originally written in Python 2.7 and later adapted for modern Python 3.

The package is divided into two sub-units: Instruments and utility functions that help carry out a electronic measurement.
It allows you to connect to various electronic measurement equipment in few lines of code.
