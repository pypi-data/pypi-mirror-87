This module provides a single function ``solve_qp(P, q, G, h, A, b, lb, ub,
solver=X)`` with a *solver* keyword argument to select the backend solver. The
quadratic program it solves is, in standard form:

    .. figure:: %s

where vector inequalities are taken coordinate by coordinate.

Solvers
-------

The list of supported solvers currently includes:

- Dense solvers:
    - `CVXOPT <http://cvxopt.org/>`_
    - `qpOASES <https://projects.coin-or.org/qpOASES>`_
    - `quadprog <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/quadprog>`_
- Sparse solvers:
    - `ECOS <https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/papers/ecos.html>`_
    - `Gurobi <https://www.gurobi.com/>`_
    - `MOSEK <https://mosek.com/>`_
    - `OSQP <https://github.com/oxfordcontrol/osqp>`_

Example
-------

To solve a quadratic program, simply build the matrices that define it and call
the ``solve_qp`` function:

.. code:: python

    from numpy import array, dot
    from qpsolvers import solve_qp

    M = array([[1., 2., 0.], [-8., 3., 2.], [0., 1., 1.]])
    P = dot(M.T, M)  # quick way to build a symmetric matrix
    q = dot(array([3., 2., 3.]), M).reshape((3,))
    G = array([[1., 2., 1.], [2., 0., 1.], [-1., 2., -1.]])
    h = array([3., 2., -2.]).reshape((3,))
    A = array([1., 1., 1.])
    b = array([1.])

    print("QP solution:", solve_qp(P, q, G, h, A, b))

This example outputs the solution ``[0.30769231, -0.69230769,  1.38461538]``.
