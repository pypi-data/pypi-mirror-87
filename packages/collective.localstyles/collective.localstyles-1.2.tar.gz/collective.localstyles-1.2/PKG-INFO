Description: collective.localstyles
        ======================
        
        With this Plone Addon you can add local styles within a subsection of your
        Plone site.
        
        After installation you can upload a css file, named ``localstyles.css``
        anywhere to a folderish content item. This css file is then included for this
        folder and all content items below. The traversing stops for ``ISite`` based
        objects, which a ``localstyles.css`` file within a ``ISite`` (e.g. a
        ``collective.lineage`` site) isn't used for folders, which are in higher
        hierachy of the content tree.
        
        This product registers a viewlet named ``collective.localstyles.viewlet``,
        which is included in ``plone.app.layout.viewlets.interfaces.IHtmlHead`` and is
        responsible for injecting the ``localstyles.css`` file.
        
        This product is inspired by this discussion:
