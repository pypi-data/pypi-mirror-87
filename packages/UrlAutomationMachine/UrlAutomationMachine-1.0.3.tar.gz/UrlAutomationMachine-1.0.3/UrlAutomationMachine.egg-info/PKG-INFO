Description: # URLAutomationMachine
        
        The machine we all need but the one we most likely do not deserve. The url checking program we all desire
        
        # Features:
        
        - Uses regex to parse each line for a url
        - Processes each request and checks status code for successful attempt
        - Any url with a status code around ```200``` will pass automation
        - Urls with a status code of ```404``` or ```400``` will fail automation
        - Urls with a status code that is unknown ```403``` will fail automation but will be displayed in grey colouring
        - Flags are used to pass in filenames and describe the version of the file.
        - ```-j``` option allows for program to display the output in a JSON format
