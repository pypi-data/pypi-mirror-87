Introduction
------------

CAMeL Tools is  suite of Arabic natural language processing tools developed by
the
`CAMeL Lab <http://camel-lab.com>`_
at `New York University Abu Dhabi <http://nyuad.nyu.edu/>`_.

    **Please use** `GitHub Issues <https://github.com/CAMeL-Lab/camel_tools/issues>`_
    **to report a bug or if you need help using CAMeL Tools.**


Installation
------------

You will need Python 3.6 and above (64-bit).

Linux/macOS
~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _linux-macos-install-pip:

Install using pip
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install camel-tools

   # or run the following if you already have camel_tools installed
   pip install camel-tools --upgrade --force-reinstall


.. _linux-macos-install-source:

Install from source
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: bash

   # Clone the repo
   git clone https://github.com/CAMeL-Lab/camel_tools.git
   cd camel_tools

   # Install from source
   pip install .

   # or run the following if you already have camel_tools installed
   pip install --upgrade --force-reinstall .

.. _linux-macos-install-data:

Installing data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To install the data sets required by CAMeL Tools components run one of the
following:

.. code-block:: bash

   # To install all data sets
   camel_data full

   # or for a light weight package for morphology and MLE disambiguation only
   camel_data light

See `Available Packages <https://camel-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cli/camel_data.html#available-packages>`_
for a comparison.

By default, data is stored in ``~/.camel_tools``.
Alternatively, if you would like to install the data in a different location,
you need to set the :code:`CAMELTOOLS_DATA` environment variable to the desired
path.

Add the following to your :code:`.bashrc`, :code:`.zshrc`, :code:`.profile`,
etc:

.. code-block:: bash

   export CAMELTOOLS_DATA=/path/to/camel_tools_data

Windows
~~~~~~~

**Note:** CAMeL Tools has been tested on Windows 10. The Dialect Identification
component is not available on Windows at this time.

.. _windows-install-pip:

Install using pip
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install camel-tools -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html

   # or run the following if you already have camel_tools installed
   pip install --upgrade --force-reinstall -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html camel-tools

.. _windows-install-source:

Install from source
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: bash

   # Clone the repo
   git clone https://github.com/CAMeL-Lab/camel_tools.git
   cd camel_tools

   # Install from source
   pip install -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html .
   pip install --upgrade --force-reinstall -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html .

.. _windows-install-data:

Installing data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To install the data packages required by CAMeL Tools components, run one of the
following commands:

.. code-block:: bash

   # To install all data sets
   camel_data full

   # or for a light weight package for morphology and MLE disambiguation only
   camel_data light

See `Available Packages <https://camel-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cli/camel_data.html#available-packages>`_
for a comparison.

By default, data is stored in
``C:\Users\your_user_name\AppData\Roaming\camel_tools``.
Alternatively, if you would like to install the data in a different location,
you need to set the ``CAMELTOOLS_DATA`` environment variable to the desired
path. Below are the instructions to do so (on Windows 10):

* Press the **Windows** button and type ``env``.
* Click on **Edit the system environment variables (Control panel)**.
* Click on the **Environment Variables...** button.
* Click on the **New...** button under the **User variables** panel.
* Type ``CAMELTOOLS_DATA`` in the **Variable name** input box and the
  desired data path in **Variable value**. Alternatively, you can browse for the
  data directory by clicking on the **Browse Directory...** button.
* Click **OK** on all the opened windows.


Documentation
-------------

You can find the
`full online documentation here <https://camel-tools.readthedocs.io>`_ for both
the command-line tools and the Python API.

Alternatively, you can build your own local copy of the documentation as
follows:

.. code-block:: bash

   # Install dependencies
   pip install sphinx recommonmark sphinx-rtd-theme

   # Go to docs subdirectory
   cd docs

   # Build HTML docs
   make html

This should compile all the HTML documentation in to ``docs/build/html``.
