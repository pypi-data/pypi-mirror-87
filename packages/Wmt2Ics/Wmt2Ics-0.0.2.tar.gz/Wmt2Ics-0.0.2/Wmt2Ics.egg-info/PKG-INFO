Description: # Wmt2Ics
        
        ## Description
        
        Using Web Schedules (wmtscheduler or wmt) **Views: My Schedule** as data, highlight and copy the pay period schedule and paste this data into **Terminal** window to be parsed and processed into a Internet Calendar Sharing file (.ics) which can then be imported into Apple iCal, Google Calendar, etc. 
        
        ## Information
        
        Built and tested in Python 3.8
        
        This module takes advantage of python library [icalendar](https://pypi.org/project/icalendar/) which is a [RFC5545](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5545.txt) parser/generator for iCalendar files.
        
        ### Use Case 1
        
        1.  Create a python file:
        
        ```python3
        #!/usr/bin/env python3 
        
        from wmt2ics import Wmt2Ics as wmt
        
        Wmt("desktop") # This will cause the script to save your Pay_Period_xx.ics file on your desktop
        ```
        2. Save the file and **make it executable**.
        3. Navigate to [Web Scheduler](https://wmtscheduler.faa.gov/WMT_LogOn/), once logged in, select **Views**, then **My Schedule**.
        4. Copy the the pay period by highlighting and ```Ctrl+c``` to copy.
        5. Go to **Terminal** and ./yourfile.py here to run it.
           * Enter the pay period number - This will be part of your saved .ics file
           * Next it was ask you to paste data - if you are in linux, you'll have to press ```Shift+Ctrl+v``` to paste in **terminal window**
        6. Once completed you should find "Pay_Period_XX.ics" on your desktop. If you are using a Mac, you can open your iCal program and import the file.
           * You can also import to Google Calendar
           * If you have a linux computer, or windows computer, but use an iPhone, I suggest **Use Case #2**
        
        ### Use Case 2 (Sligtly more involved)
        
        1.  Create a python file:
        
        ```python3
        #!/usr/bin/env python3
        from wmt2ics import Wmt2Ics as wmt
        
        wmt.Setup('smtp.gmail.com','587','sender@gmail.com','password','receiver@gmail.com')
        wmt("email") 
        ```
         
        **'smtp.gmail.com'**
        The SMTP server for the email account used to send the .ics file
        
        **'587'**
        The port number for the SMTP server, here, i've placed the port for gmail's smtp
        
        **'sender@gmail.com'**
        Here I use a gmail address to send the email, I created this email 
        account specifically to use as a sender email for this script. You may use whatever you 
        wish.
        
        **'password'**
        Gmail supports "app passwords", this is where you will place the app password.
        if you would rather be slightly more secretive about this, if you leave it blank, the 
        method will attempt to use an environment variable named 'GMAIL_APP_PWD' which you will
        have to set on your local machine. I set mine in /etc/environment, you'll have to research
        how to do so on Google for Windows and Mac.
        
        **'receiver@gmail.com'**
        Where you want it to go!
        
        So all that being said, you'll need to get an app password for an email account or use an account that allows using just your sign in password.
