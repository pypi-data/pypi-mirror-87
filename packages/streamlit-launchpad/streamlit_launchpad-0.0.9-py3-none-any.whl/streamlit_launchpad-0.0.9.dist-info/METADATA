# Streamlit Launchpad

Web launchpad to browse a folder containing multiple Streamlit applications (py files), with a central launchpad listing available apps so you can run them (if not already running) and view each in its own tab.

This is a very basic alpha version. Windows is not supported.

```
pip install streamlit-launchpad
```

Serves *.py as separate Streamlit applications from the folder supplied on the command line:
