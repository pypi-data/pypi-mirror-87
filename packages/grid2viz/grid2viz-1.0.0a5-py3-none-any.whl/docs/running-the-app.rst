Running the application

In order to use this tool, you need to have serialized the RL process of grid2op. The expected file system is :
 - root_dir
          - agent_1
                  - scenario_1
                  - scenario_2
          - agent_2
                  - scenario_1
                  - scenario_2
                  - scenario_3

Each of the scenario_* files have to contain all files given by serialisation of your RL through grid2op.
In order to add a new agent to the app, you will have to add the agent's folder to this root_dir
For the update process of this folder chain, see the section `Caching` (in particular, when you want to overwrite the current agents in root_dir with new versions with the same names)

The grid2viz commandline tool allows to start the server and provide all the necessary information. The help function of the tool can be found below.

.. code-block:: RST

    usage: grid2viz [-h] [--agents_path AGENTS_PATH] [--env_path ENV_PATH]
                    [--port PORT] [--debug]

    Grid2Viz

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      --agents_path AGENTS_PATH
                            The path where the log of the Agents experiences are
                            stored. (default to None to study the example agents
                            provided with the package)
      --port PORT           The port to serve grid2viz on. (default to 8050)
      --debug               Enable debug mode for developers. (default to False)

For example, to run the server on port 8000 with the default agents provided in the :doc: `Starting-Kit<starting-kit>`: 

.. code-block:: RST

    source venv_grid2viz/bin/activate
    grid2viz --port 8000

**WARNING:** Due to the caching operation the first run can take a while. All the agents present in the configuration files
will be computed and then registered in cache. Depending on your agents it could take between 5 to 15min. You can follow the progress in the console.*
