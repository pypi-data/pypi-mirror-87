ViroCon is a software to compute environmental contours.

About
-----

viroconcom is a software package to compute environmental contours. It
is written in Python 3.7.4 and belongs to the software ViroCon, which also
offers a GUI for some functionality via the package viroconweb_.

ViroCon helps you to design marine structures, which need to withstand
load combinations based on wave, wind and current. It lets you define
extreme environmental conditions with a given return period using the
environmental contour method.

The following methods are implemented in viroconcom:

- Defining a joint probability distributions using a global hierarchical model structure
- Estimating the parameters of a global hierarchical model ("Fitting")
- Computing an environmental contour using either the

  - inverse first-order reliability method (IFORM),
  - inverse second-order reliability method (ISORM),
  - the direct sampling contour method or the
  - highest density contour method.

How to use viroconcom
---------------------
Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Make sure you have installed Python `3.8` by typing

.. code:: console

   python --version

in your `shell`_.

(Older version might work, but are not actively tested)

Consider using the python version management `pyenv`_.


Install
~~~~~~~
Install the latest version of viroconcom from PyPI by typing

.. code:: console

   pip install viroconcom


Alternatively, you can install from viroconcom repository’s Master branch
by typing

.. code:: console

   pip install https://github.com/virocon-organization/viroconcom/archive/master.zip


Usage
~~~~~

viroconcom is designed as an importable package.

The folder `examples`_ contains python files that show how one can
import and use viroconcom.

As an example, to run the file `sea_state_iform_contour.py`_, use
your shell to navigate to the folder that contains the file. Make sure
that you have installed matplotlib and run the Python file by typing

.. code:: console

   python sea_state_iform_contour.py

Our documentation contains a user guide, with  examples how to
`fit a distribution`_ to measurement data and how to
`compute environmental contours`_.
