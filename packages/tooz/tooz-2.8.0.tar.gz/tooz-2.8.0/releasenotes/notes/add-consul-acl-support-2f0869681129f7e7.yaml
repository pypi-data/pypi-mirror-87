features:
  - |
    Added support for Consul ACL tokens. Consul ACL tokens can be passed in as
    a parameterized argument. Requires python-consul2
upgrade:
  - |
    Updated the python-consul library to python-consul2. The original library is
    no longer maintained while python-consul2 is reasonably maintained. Consul 1.4
    has a new ACL implementation, and Consul 1.7 includes some standards enforcement
    which break python-consul.
