About
=====

This Python logging handler is a fork of
https://github.com/vklochan/python-logstash.

It adds the following features:

  * Asynchronous transport of log events
  * Store log events temporarily in a cache until transport
    to the Logstash server has been successful
  * Transport of events via TCP, UDP and the Beats protocol
  * TCP transport optionally SSL-encrypted
  * Special formatter ready to be used in Django projects
  * Special formatter ready to be used in Flask projects


Asynchronous processing
-----------------------

Unlike the original ``python-logstash``, this handler will try to
handle log events as fast as possible so that the sending program
code can continue with its primary job.
In other words, for web applications or web services it is important
to not slow down request times due to logging delays, e.g. waiting
for network timeouts to the Logstash server or similar.

So this handler will accept log events and pass them for further
processing to a separate worker thread which will try to send
the events to the configured Logstash server asynchronously.
If sending the events fails, the events are stored in a
local cache for a later attempt sending the events.

Whenever the application stops, to be more exact whenever
Python' logging subsystem is shutdown, the worker thread
is signaled to send any queued events and clean up itself
before shutdown.

The interval and timeout settings used for transmitting
can be configured in the ``logstash_async.constants``
module.
See :ref:`module-constants` for details.


Differences to using FileBeat
-----------------------------

While `FileBeat <https://www.elastic.co/de/products/beats/filebeat>`_
provides similar features like ``python-logstash-async``, there are
also a few differences which make this package worth using:

  - FileBeat needs to be installed and configured on the server
    independently from the application - this is an advantage and
    disadvantage - depending on the environment and deployment
    strategy.

    Deploying FileBeat server-side can be useful if multiple
    applications are hosted on a server and one FileBeat instance can
    handle the log files of all those applications.

    However, in a Docker / Kubernetes / whatever container world,
    one likely rather have an application as the single process running
    in the container and one does not want to have sidecar containers or
    so just to send the log events to Logstash.

  - FileBeat process log files, i.e. one need to write the log messages
    to a log file using a certain format and then have FileBeat or
    Logstash parse this format again to get a structured log event
    again - ``python-logstash-async`` sends a structured log event
    already to Logstash, no need for additional parsing and gives
    much more flexibility to add custom data to the the events without
    struggling with a logfile format.

  - When exceptions with stack traces included or other multi line
    messages are to be logged, FileBeat or Logstash needs to be
    configured carefully to properly detect and handle multiline log
    messages - with ``python-logstash-async`` no special handling of
    multiline log events is necessary as it cleanly integrates
    with Python's logging framework.

After all, both approaches are valid and have their own use cases.
Which fits best depends on the application and its requirements.

ChangeLog
---------

2.2.0 (Dec 05 2020)
+++++++++++++++++++

  * Add SynchronousLogstashHandler: operates like the
    AsynchronousLogstashHandler but synchronously and without any
    event queueing and retrying (#59, #60, Sascha Pfeiffer).


2.1.1 (Nov 04 2020)
+++++++++++++++++++

  * Fix missing message field in events (#58).


2.1.0 (Nov 02 2020)
+++++++++++++++++++

  * Remove "six" dependency.
  * Add "HTTP Input" transport (#56, Jürgen Löhel).
  * Skip logging stacktraces for common network errors
    (#55, #56, Walter Macomber).
  * Extend FORMATTER_RECORD_FIELD_SKIP_LIST to filter
    all record fields (#52).
  * Docs: Fix error in logging.config.fileConfig code example
    (#54, Guy).


2.0.0 (Aug 16 2020)
+++++++++++++++++++

  * Require Python >= 3.5.


1.6.7 (Aug 16 2020)
+++++++++++++++++++

  * Set `python_requires` to Python >=2.7 or Python >= 3.5 for
    smooth upgrade to upcoming Python3 only.
    This way Python2 only users will stay at this release.


1.6.6 (Jun 08 2020)
+++++++++++++++++++

  * Fix socket timeout setting ignored for filebeat
    (#50, Koert van der Veer).


1.6.5 (Jun 06 2020)
+++++++++++++++++++

  * Add "@metadata" to the generated event in Formatter, useful for
    common beats input configuration in Logstash
    (#49, Sudheer Satyanarayana).
  * Don't convert text to bytes in Formatter
    (fix #45) (#46, Sergey Trofimov).


1.6.4 (Jan 23 2020)
+++++++++++++++++++

  * Fix accessing request's META attribute in DjangoLogstashFormatter


1.6.3 (Jan 23 2020)
+++++++++++++++++++

  * Handle DisallowedHost exceptions in DjangoLogstashFormatter
    to not trigger an exception while formatting.


1.6.2 (Nov 30 2019)
+++++++++++++++++++

  * When sending all events, stop on errors.
    Otherwise retrying happens forever on non-recoverable errors.
