# ircrobots

## rationale
I wanted a very-bare-bones IRC bot framework that deals with most of the
concerns one would deal with in scheduling and awaiting async stuff, e.g.
creating and awaiting a new task for each server while dynamically being able
to add/remove servers.

## usage
see [examples/](examples/) for some usage demonstration.
