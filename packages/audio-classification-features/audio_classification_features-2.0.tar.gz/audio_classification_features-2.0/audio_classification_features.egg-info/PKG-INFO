Description: # Audio Classification Features
        It is made to extract the features from any audio dataset. User's have to provide location of the dataset folder and this library will produce x and y npy files. We also provide custom built Keras model for training.
        # Installation
        ```sh
        $ pip install audio_classification_features
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        ### Making Training Dataset
        ```py
        from audio_classification_features import audio_features as af
        af().extractor('dataset')
        ```
        
        These npy files are loaded with numpy using following commands:
        ```py
        import numpy
        x=np.load('x.npy')
        y=np.load('y.npy')
        ```
        
        ### Training Custom Built Model
        ```py
        #input_shape generated by this package is of shape (9,13,1)
        input_shape=(9,13,1)
        ```
        
        ### Making Predictions
        ```py 
        from audio_classification_features import audio_features as af
        
        #filename example: audio_test.wav
        #num_classes same as above 
        #model
        
        af().make_prediction(filename,num_classes,model)
        ```
        
        # Dataset Structure
        >folder name of audio will be used as label.
        
        * dataset
            * audio class 1
                * audiofile.wav
            * audio class 2
                * audiofile.wav
