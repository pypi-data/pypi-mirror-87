/*! QML entry-point
 *
 * This file is loaded from Python and in turn loads
 * the actual application. The application is then loaded
 * in an asynchronous fashion so as to display the window
 * as quickly as possible.
 *
 * "app.qml" is a separate file because we can delay
 * importing the custom QML modules.
 *
 * See app.qml for next step.
