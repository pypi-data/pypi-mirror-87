Description: # selenium_helpers
        Helpful utilities and wrappers for Selenium work.
        
        There are two key utilities in here -
        
        ## Click
        Used to resolve issues caused while clicking an element.
        Very often, elements are overlayed in such a way that a click isn't as simple as it should be.
        
        This addresses that; simple call it with -
        ```python
        click(driver, element)
        ```
        
        
        ## Wait Until
        
        Allows you to wait until some condition is met.
        
        The following conditions are supported -
        
        1. Title Is
        2. Title Contains
        3. URL Matches
        4. URL Is
        5. URL Contains
        6. You Find
        7. You Find All
        8. You Find Text
        9. You Find Button Text
        10. You Find All Text
        11. You Find Placeholder
        12. You Don't Find
        
        ```python
        wait_until(driver, 'title is', 'Google')
        ```
