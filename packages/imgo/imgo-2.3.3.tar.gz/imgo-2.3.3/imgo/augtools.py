        Constructs all the necessary attributes for the augmenter.

        Once initialized, the augmenter applies one or more augmentation
        functions to the image, depending on which keyword arguments are
        given, in a random order. If the batch is randomized (specified
        with the randomize_params argument), the functions will be applied
        using a random parameter inferred from the argument given.

        Note that in order to be augmented, images must be in non-
        normalized.

        Keyword Arguments:
            rotate_range (list or tuple) optional: range (min, max) in
            degrees from which a random rotation angle is drawn. The
            corresponding aug_rotate function will rotate each image by
            a randomly chosen angle within this range. Defaults to None.
            -
            shear_range (list or tuple) optional: range (min, max) in
            degrees from which a random shear angle is drawn. The
            corresponding aug_shear function will apply a shear
            adjustment to each image at a randomly chosen angle within
            this range. Defaults to None.
            -
            dropout_pair (list or tuple) optional: amount and
            degree (or ranges of both if batch is randomized) of random
            pixel dropout applied, where the first element in the list
            or tuple is the proportion of pixels to be dropped, and the
            second is the proportional size of the image from which to
            drop the pixels (thereby increasing the size of the dropped
            portions). Defaults to None.
            -
            x_scale (list or tuple) optional: range (min, max)
            proportional to image size from which an x-axis scale value is
            drawn. The corresponding aug_x_scale function will scale the
            image to this value along the x-axis. Defaults to None.
            -
            y_scale (list or tuple) optional: range (min, max)
            proportional to image size from which an y-axis scale value is
            drawn. The corresponding aug_y_scale function will scale the
            image to this value along the y-axis. Defaults to None.
            -
            x_shift (list or tuple) optional: range relative
            to image size from which a random x-axis translation is drawn.
            The corresponding aug_x_shift function will shift each image
            on the x-axis by a randomly chosen proportion within this
            range. Defaults to None.
            -
            y_shift (list or tuple) optional: range relative
            to image size from which a random y-axis translation is drawn.
            The corresponding aug_y_shift function will shift each image
            on the y-axis by a randomly chosen proportion within this
            range. Defaults to None.
            -
            clip_limit (list or tuple) optional: range from
            which random clip limits for CLAH equalization are drawn.
            The corresponding aug_clahe function will apply a CLAH
            equalization to each image using a clip limit uniformly
            sampled from the range. Defaults to None.
            -
            pwa_scale (list or tuple) optional: range relative
            to image size from which random piecewise affine translations
            are drawn. The first element of the list or tuple is the
            upper bound of the range from which the translation amount of
            each point in the image is randomly sampled. The second
            element is the upper bound of the range from which the first
            element is sampled, and is randomly applied to each image.
            The corresponding aug_pwa function will apply a piecewise
            affine translation to local areas of the image using these
            ranges. Defaults to None.
            -
            h_flip (float) optional: proportion of images on
            which a horizontal flip is performed. The corresponding
            aug_h_flip function will flip these images horizontally.
            Defaults to None.
            -
            v_flip (float) optional: proportion of images on
            which a vertical flip is performed. The corresponding
            aug_v_flip function will flip these images vertically.
            Defaults to None.
            -
            g_sev (int) optional: amount (or range if batch
            is randomized) of severity with which Gaussian noise is

            noise to the images. Defaults to None.
            -
            b_sev (int) optional: amount (or range if batch
            is randomized) of severity with which brightness is altered.

            brightness of the images. Defaults to None.
            -
            e_sev (int) optional: amount (or range if batch
            is randomized) of severity with which elastic transformation
            is applied. The corresponding aug_elastic function will
            apply the transformation to local areas of the image.
            Defaults to None.
            -
            contrast (bool) optional: whether or not random
            contrast adjustment is applied. If the batch is randomized, a
            random proportion of the images will be adjusted by the
            corresponding aug_contrast function. Defaults to False.
            -
            sharpness (bool) optional: whether or not random
            sharpness adjustment is applied. If the batch is randomized,
            a random proportion of the images will be adjusted by the
            corresponding aug_sharpness function. Defaults to False.
            -
            fill_mode (str) optional: which method to use to fill any
            pixels created by any of the augmentation functions. Choose
            from "edge" (fills with the same value as that of the edge of
            the array), or "reflect" (reflects the pixel values along edge
            of the array). If None, will fill with a constant value.
            Defaults to None.
            -
            randomize_params (bool) optional: whether the
            augmentation parameters applied are fixed as the input given
            or are randomly drawn from a range inferred from the input
            given. If False, the same transformation parameters will be
            used for each image in the batch. Defaults to False.

        Returns:
            Augmenter object.

        Augmenter object. Depending on the parameters given, a subset of

        augmented.

        Note that this function requires the image data to be in image
        form (as opposed to numpy-arrays) and located in the relevant
        directories, ie a single image directory (the base path) or a
        subdirectory for each class within the image directory.

            neither number nor size arguments are given, each image from

            doubling the size of the dataset. Defaults to None.
            -
            save (bool) optional: whether or not to save the images in
            the directory given as the base_path argument. If the
