        = Generating a Pickle token file =
        The library is set to only accept already generated token stored in a .pickle file.

        You can read more about pickle file here -> https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html.

        Generating a pickle token can easily be done by using the code snippet below. Just replace the variables to        \
            generate your token.

        Before running the code below, first enable Google Sheets API on your account. Place the credentials.json file in  \
            the same directory as the snippet will be.

        Simply follow this quickstart guide from Google Sheets API v4                                                      \

        = Reading Google Sheets Ranges =
        The Sheets API allows you to read values from cells, ranges, sets of ranges and entire sheets.
        For these examples, assume the spreadsheet being read has the following data in its first sheet ("Sheet1"):
        |                   | =A=               | =B=           | =C=                   | =D=                                   |
        | =1=               | Item              | Cost          | Stocked               | Ship Date                             |
        | =2=               | Wheel             | $20.50        | 4                     | 3/1/2016                              |
        | =3=               | Door              | $15           | 2                     | 3/15/2016                             |
        | =4=               | Engine            | $100          | 1                     | 3/20/2016                             |

        == Reading from a Single Range ==

        Reading the value/s of a single range can be done by using `Fetch Single Range` Keyword.

        Example:

         - To be able to read the all the data from ``Item`` column up to the ``Stocked`` column. We can address it by:
        | `Fetch Single Range`          | Sheet1!A1:C           |# fetches all columns starting from A1 up to C5                |

         - To be able to read the all the data from ``Item`` column up to the ``Stocked`` column but, we only want to fetch \
             up to 3 rows, We can do so by:
        | `Fetch Single Range`          | Sheet1!A1:C3          | # fetches all data in A-C columns but only fetches data   \
                                                                    up to the 3rd row.                                          |

        == Reading from Multiple Ranges ==

        Examples:

         - To read multiple ranges from the initialized spreadsheet, It is useful to use `Fetch Multiple Range`
           Keyword.
        | @{ranges}                 | Create List               | Sheet1!A1:E       | Sheet1!A1:E1  |
        | `Fetch Multiple Range`    | ${ranges}                 |                   |               |
        | ${data_from_range}        | `Fetch Multiple Range`    | ${ranges}         |               |

        == valueRenderOption ==

        Data returned could be set using the ``valueRenderOption``. Refer below for the options that could be passed.

        | =Options=                 | =Description=                                                                             |
        | FORMATTED_VALUE           | Values will be calculated & formatted in the reply according to the cell's formatting.\
                                         Formatting is based on the spreadsheet's locale, not the requesting user's locale. \
                                             For example, if A1 is 1.23 and A2 is =A1 and formatted as currency, then A2    \
                                                 would return "$1.23".                                                          |
        | UNFORMATTED_VALUE         | Values will be calculated, but not formatted in the reply. For example, if A1 is 1.23 \
                                        and A2 is =A1 and formatted as currency, then A2 would return the number 1.23.          |
        | FORMULA                   | Values will not be calculated. The reply will include the formulas. For example, if A1\
                                        is 1.23 and A2 is =A1 and formatted as currency, then A2 would return "=A1".            |

        Examples:

        | Fetch Single Range        | Sheet1!A1:C   | valueRenderOption=FORMATTED_VALUE  | # Returns sheet values in the    \
                                                        selected range in a formatted value.                                    |
        | Fetch Single Range        | Sheet1!A1:C   | valueRenderOption=FORMULA          | # Returns the formula applied on \
                                                                                            the selected range.                 |
        | Fetch Multiple Range      | @{ranges}     | valueRenderOption=UNFORMATTED_DATA | # Returns the raw values from the\
                                                                                            selected ranges.                    |

        = Writing to Google Sheet Ranges =

        == BatchUpdateValuesRequest ==

        Sets values in one or more ranges of a spreadsheet. The caller must specify the spreadsheet ID, a `valueInputOption`, \
            and one or more `ValueRange`.

        A range along a single dimension on a sheet. All indexes are zero-based. Indexes are half open: \
            the start index is inclusive and the end index is exclusive. \
                Missing indexes indicate the range is unbounded on that side.

        The body of the update request must be a `ValueRange` object, though the only required field is
            values. If range is specified, it must match the range in the URL. In the ValueRange, you
                can optionally specify its majorDimension. By default, ROWS is used. If COLUMNS is
                    specified, each inner array is written to a column instead of a row.

        *NOTE*: The majorDimension parameter does not control if data is added as rows or columns to
            the table. Data will always be added to subsequent rows. The parameter only controls how
                the input data is read.

        The input ``range_name`` is used to search for existing data and find a "table" within that range.
        Values are appended to the next row of the table, starting with the first column of the table.
        For example, consider a sheet *Sheet1* that looks like:
        |       | =A=   | =B=   | =C=   | =D=   | =E=   |
        | =1=   | x     | y     | z     |       |       |

        | =3=   |       |       |       |       |       |
        | =4=   |       | x     | y     |       |       |
        | =5=   |       |       | y     | z     |       |
        | =6=   |       | x     | y     | z     |       |
        | =7=   |       |       |       |       |       |

        There are two tables in the sheet: ``A1:C2``, and ``B4:D6``. Append values would begin at ``B7``
        for all the following ``range`` inputs:
            - ``Sheet1``, because it will examine all the data in the sheet, determine that the table at
                ``B4:D6`` is the last table.
            - ``B4`` or ``C5:D5``, because they're both in the ``B4:D6`` table.
            - ``B2:D4``, because the last table in the range is the ``B4:D6`` table (despite also containing
                the ``A1:C2`` table).
            - ``A3:G10``, because the last table in the range is the ``B4:D6`` table (despite starting before
                and ending after it).

        The following ``range`` inputs would not start writing at ``B7``:
            - ``A1`` would start writing at ``A3``, because that's in the ``A1:C2`` table.
            - ``E4`` would not start writing at ``E4``, because it's not in any table. (``A4`` would also start
                writing at ``A4`` for the same reasons.)

        Additionally, you can choose if you want to overwrite existing data after a table or insert new rows
        for the new data. By default, the input overwwrites data after the table. To write the new data
        into new rows, specify ``insertDataOption==INSERT_ROWS``.

        Refer to the `InsertDataOption` for the accepted arguments.
