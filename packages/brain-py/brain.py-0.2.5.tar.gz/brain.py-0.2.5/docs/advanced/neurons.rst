Neuron models
=============

In this section, we want to tell you how the `neurons` model is
designed in NumpyBrain, and how to define your own customized neuron
models.

The design of the ``neurons`` object
------------------------------------

A `neurons` object in NumpyBrain represents a neuron group. It has four
important attributes and one essential function.

state
*****

In a *neurons* model, ``state`` (see Figure 1) is a two-dimensional matrix
:math:`(M, N)`, which contains all variables defined in the neuron group,
including the dynamical variable like membrane potential :math:`V` and the
static variable like external input :math:`I_{ext}`. :math:`M` is the number
of the variables, :math:`N` is the number of the neurons in the group.

    Figure 1. The state of the neuron group.

In addition to the allowed user-defined variable states, the `state` of every
neuron group has five fixed variables (see the rows with light-green color in
the Figure 1).

1. The first fixed variable records whether the neurons are not in the refractory
   period. If one's value is `0.`, it means this neuron is in the refractory
   period.
2. The second fixed variable denotes whether the neurons' membrane potential
   are above the firing threshold. When the value is `1.`, the corresponding
   neuron is in the spiking state. This variable is useful to judge
   spike for a neuron model without membrane potential reset. For example, for a
   Hodgkin–Huxley neuron, when the spiking criteria is only :math:`V > V_{th}`,
   the user will get a series of spikes. The correct way of spike judgement at
   time :math:`t` is to use
   :math:`(V > V_{th})\, \& \, (not \, {above\_threshold}^{t-1})`.
3. The third fixed variable denotes whether the neurons reach the spiking state.
   The value `1.` means the corresponding neuron generates a spike. This variable
   state should be distinguished from the second fixed variable. When a neuron
   is in the spiking state (maybe last for 1-2 ms, i.e., :math:`V > V_{th}`),
   the former will get one `1.` value, while the latter will get a series of `1.`.
4. The fourth fixed variable is the neurons' spiking times. This variable is
   useful to judge whether neurons are in refractory period. When
   :math:`t - t^{sp} < t^{delay}`, the neuron is still refractory.
5. The fifth fixed variable is the inputs that neurons receive, including the
   external input and synaptic input.

Using the pre-defined five variables, with the addition of user-specified
variables, the `neurons` model is able to flexibly implement various neuron
models.


var2index
*********

``var2index`` is an important attribute for neuron recording. It is an interface
for `monitor` recording, in which `var2index` tells the monitor where is the
position of the variables going to record. For example,

.. code-block:: python

    var2index = {'V': 0, 'm': 1, 'h': 2, 'n': 3}

represents the variable :math:`V`, :math:`m`, :math:`h` and :math:`n` is at
row `0`, `1`, `2` and `3` in the `state` matrix, respectively.

num and geometry
****************

``num`` and ``geometry`` should also be explicitly pointed out. `num` is the
total number of neurons in the group. It lose the network's geometry information.
Therefore, `geometry` is important for recording the dimensions of the neuron
group. For example, for a two-dimensional lattice :math:`(10, 20)`,
:math:`geometry=(10, 20)` records the information of height `10` and
width `20`, while :math:`num=200` records the groups' total number `200`.
The former is important for the connection between groups, and the latter is
essential for the model state regulation and running.

update_state()
**************

``update_state()`` function points out how the neuron model evolves.

.. code-block:: python

    def update_state(neu_state, t):
        do_something ...

This function receive two arguments: ``neu_state`` and ``t``. It is
written according to the differential equations of the neuron models.
In order to make the numerical integration of differential equations easier,
NumpyBrain provides a decorator function ``@integrate`` to help construct
numerical integration functions. The supported integration algorithms please
see `Numerical integrators <numerical_integrators.rst>`_.

Define your own neuron models
-----------------------------

Leaky integrate-and-fire model
*******************************

Let's take LIF neuron as an example to learn how to define your own neuron models.

First of all, import the package

.. code-block:: python

    import npbrain as nn


LIF model is described by

.. math::
    \tau \frac{dV}{dt} = -(V(t) - V_r) + RI(t) \quad (1)

where :math:`V(t)` represents the membrane potential at time :math:`t`,
:math:`\tau` is the membrane time constant,
:math:`V_r` is the resting membrane potential,
:math:`R` is the membrane resistance, and
:math:`I_{t}` is the external input.

In LIF model, we have only one variable :math:`V`, thus we define the
``state`` and ``var2index`` by

.. code-block:: python

    var2index = {'V': 0}
    state = nn.initial_neu_state(1, num)

The state updating function can be coded according to Equation (1):

.. code-block:: python

    @nn.integrate(method='rk4')
    def int_f(V, t, Isyn):
        return (-V + Vr + R * Isyn) / tau

    def update_state(neu_state, t):
        # input
        Isyn = neu_state[-1]
        
        # update state
        V_new = int_f(neu_state[0], t, Isyn)
        neu_state[0] = V_new

        # judge spikes
        spike_idx = nn.judge_spike(neu_state, Vth, t)

        # reset
        neu_state[0][spike_idx] = V_reset


Putting together, we get the full LIF model:

.. code-block:: python

    
    def LIF(geometry, tau=100, Vr=0., Vth=1., R=1.):
        var2index = dict(V=0)
        num, geometry = nn.format_geometry(geometry)

        state = nn.initial_neu_state(1, num)
        state[0] = V_reset

        @nn.integrate(method='rk4')
        def int_f(V, t, Isyn):
            return (-V + Vr + R * Isyn) / tau

        def update_state(neu_state, t):
            # input
            Isyn = neu_state[-1]
            
            # update state
            V_new = int_f(neu_state[0], t, Isyn)
            neu_state[0] = V_new

            # judge spikes
            spike_idx = nn.judge_spike(neu_state, Vth, t)

            # reset
            neu_state[0][spike_idx] = V_reset

        return nn.Neurons(**locals())


Hodgkin–Huxley neuron model
***************************

Similarly, Hodgkin–Huxley neuron model is defined as the same way as LIF model, 
although it has more complex dynamics.

.. code-block:: python

    def HH(geometry, method=None, noise=0., E_Na=50., g_Na=120., E_K=-77.,
        g_K=36., E_Leak=-54.387, g_Leak=0.03, C=1.0, Vr=-65., Vth=20.):

        var2index = {'V': 0, 'm': 1, 'h': 2, 'n': 3}
        num, geometry = nn.format_geometry(geometry)
        state = nn.initial_neu_state(4, num)

        @nn.integrate(method=method)
        def int_m(m, t, V):
            alpha = 0.1 * (V + 40) / (1 - np.exp(-(V + 40) / 10))
            beta = 4.0 * np.exp(-(V + 65) / 18)
            return alpha * (1 - m) - beta * m

        @nn.integrate(method=method)
        def int_h(h, t, V):
            alpha = 0.07 * np.exp(-(V + 65) / 20.)
            beta = 1 / (1 + np.exp(-(V + 35) / 10))
            return alpha * (1 - h) - beta * h

        @nn.integrate(method=method)
        def int_n(n, t, V):
            alpha = 0.01 * (V + 55) / (1 - np.exp(-(V + 55) / 10))
            beta = 0.125 * np.exp(-(V + 65) / 80)
            return alpha * (1 - n) - beta * n

        @nn.integrate(method=method, noise=noise / C)
        def int_V(V, t, m, h, n, Isyn):
            INa = g_Na * m ** 3 * h * (V - E_Na)
            IK = g_K * n ** 4 * (V - E_K)
            IL = g_Leak * (V - E_Leak)
            dvdt = (- INa - IK - IL + Isyn) / C
            return dvdt

        def update_state(neu_state, t):
            V, Isyn = neu_state[0], neu_state[-1]
            m = nn.clip(int_m(neu_state[1], t, V), 0., 1.)
            h = nn.clip(int_h(neu_state[2], t, V), 0., 1.)
            n = nn.clip(int_n(neu_state[3], t, V), 0., 1.)
            V = int_V(V, t, m, h, n, Isyn)
            neu_state[0] = V
            neu_state[1] = m
            neu_state[2] = h
            neu_state[3] = n
            nn.judge_spike(neu_state, Vth, t)

        return nn.Neurons(**locals())
