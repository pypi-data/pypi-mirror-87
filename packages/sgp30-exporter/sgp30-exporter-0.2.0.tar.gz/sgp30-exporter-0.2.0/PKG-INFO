Description: # sgp30-exporter [![build-badge]](https://travis-ci.com/github/urbas/sgp30-exporter) [![pypi-badge]](https://pypi.org/project/sgp30-exporter/)
        
        Exports air quality readings from Pimoroni SGP30 to Prometheus.
        
        This exporter uses [pimoroni-sgp30] to obtain data.
        
        ## Installation
        
        ```bash
        pip install sgp30-exporter
        ```
        
        ## Running
        
        ```bash
        sudo sgp30-exporter
        ```
        
        This will serve metrics at `http://0.0.0.0:9895/metrics`.
        
        Why `sudo`? SGP30 requires read-write access to the `/dev/i2c` interface.
        
        You can make Prometheus scrape these with this scrape config:
        
        ```yaml
        scrape_configs:
          - job_name: "sgp30"
            static_configs:
              - targets: ["<the IP of your exporter host>:9895"]
                labels:
                  location: "bedroom"
        ```
