    Added new ``.is_started`` boolean flag to enginefacade context manager
    and factory objects, so that double-configure scenarios can be prevented
    by calling code.   Additionally, the ``TypeError`` raised when configure
    is called after the factory is started is now a specific subclass
    ``enginefacade.AlreadyStartedError``.
