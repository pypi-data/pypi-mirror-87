The package is used for risk control modeling in Python. 
It mainly provides some basic and commonly data analysis methods for partners who want to learn Python data analysis or machine learning in the Internet financial industry. 
It also contains a large number of solutions to the problems encountered by the authors in their daily work. 
I hope you can actively use it.
