# QFAST-QISKit: QISKit Plugin for QFAST

QFAST-QISKit packages several QISKit tools for [QFAST](https://github.com/BQSKit/qfast).
There are two native tools, KAKTool and QiskitTool, that are included.
Also, QiskitCombiner is a recombination tool that uses qiskit to
piece together small circuits. The QiskitCombiner provides circuit optimization
that isn't available with the default NaiveCombiner.

## Installation

The best way to install this python package is with pip.

```
pip install qfast-qiskit
```
