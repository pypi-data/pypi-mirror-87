"""JAX functions to construct and learn generalized value functions.

According to the reward hypothesis (Sutton et al., 2018) any goal might be
formulated as a suitable scalar `cumulant` to be maximized. Generalized value
functions (Sutton et al. 2011) extend the notion of value functions to include
estimates of discounted sums of `cumulants` different from the main task reward.

  """Calculates cumulants for pixel control tasks from an observation sequence.

  The observations are first split in a grid of KxK cells. For each cell a
  distinct pseudo reward is computed as the average absolute change in pixel
  intensity across all pixels in the cell. The change in intensity is averaged
  across both pixels and channels (e.g. RGB).

  The `observations` provided to this function should be cropped suitably, to
  ensure that the observations' height and width are a multiple of `cell_size`.
  The values of the `observations` tensor should be rescaled to [0, 1].
