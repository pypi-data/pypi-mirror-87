# AWS CDK Helpers

The purpose of this library is to allow users to create CDK Stacks to deploy
applications into pre-existing account environments, using sensible defaults
and abstractions.

Moreover, it creates a set of helper classes which make it really easy to create
SQS Queues, SNS topics and the other useful resources needed when deploying Docker
stacks to Amazon web services.
