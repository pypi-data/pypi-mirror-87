Shady is a general-purpose visual stimulus toolbox filling a similar role to Psychtoolbox,
VisionEgg, or PsychoPy. It is for programmers who work in neuroscience, especially vision
science, and addresses their need for high timing precision, linearity, high dynamic
range, and pixel-for-pixel accuracy.

It takes its name from its heavy reliance on a *shader* program to perform parallel pixel
processing on a computer's graphics processor. It was designed with an emphasis on
performance robustness in multi-tasking applications under unforgiving conditions.
For optimal timing performance, the CPU drawing management commands are carried out by
a compiled binary engine.
