# nsapiwrapper

This is a pretty simple wrapper of the [Nationstates API](https://www.nationstates.net/pages/api.html), if you want to use the nationstates api in a more high level and more documented way see [nationstates](https://github.com/DolphDev/pynationstates) which actually wraps arounds this library.
