VEUSZ(1)                           Veusz                          VEUSZ(1)

NAME
       Veusz - a scientific plotting and graphing application.

SYNOPSIS
       veusz [options] [document.vsz]...

DESCRIPTION
       Veusz is a scientific plotting and graphing package. It is designed
       to create publication-ready output in a variety of different output
       formats. Graphs are built-up combining plotting widgets. Veusz has
       a GUI user interface (started with the "veusz" command), a Python
       module interface and a scripting interface.

       If started without command line arguments, Veusz will open up with
       a new empty document. The program will otherwise open the listed
       documents.

OPTIONS
       --unsafe-mode
               Do not check opened scripts for the presence of unsafe
               Python commands. This allows you to create or open complete
               Python scripts with Veusz commands if they come from a
               trusted source.

       --listen
               Read Veusz commands from stdin, executing them, then
               writing the results to stdout. This option replaces the old
               veusz_listen.

               In this mode Veusz does not read any input documents, but
               will use the first argument to the program as the window
               title, if given.

       --quiet If in listening mode, do not open a window before running
               commands, but execute them quietly.

       --export=FILE
               Export the next Veusz document file on the command line to
               the graphics file FILE. Supported file types include EPS,
               PDF, SVG, PNG, BMP, JPG and XPM. The extension of the
               output file is used to determine the output file format.
               There should be as many export options specified as input
               Veusz documents on the command line.

       --export-option=OPT
               Adds the option given when exporting. Supported options are
               dpi=DPI giving the resolution for bitmap output files
               (default 100), color=True/False to switch to monochrome
               output (default True), page=[X,...] gives a list of pages
               to export (default [0]), where the page numbers are
               numbered from 0, antialias=True/False enables or disables
               antialiasing in bitmap output files (default True),
               quality=VAL gives the JPEG quality value (default 85),
               backcolor='#RRGGBBAA' gives the background color of bitmap
               files (default '#ffffff00'), pdfdpi=DPI gives the DPI when
               outputting to PDF files (default 150) and
               svgtextastext=True/False outputs text in SVG files as text,
               rather than as curves (default False).

       --plugin=FILE
               Loads the Veusz plugin FILE when starting Veusz. This
               option provides a per-session alternative to adding the
               plugin in the preferences dialog box.

       --help  Displays the options to the program and exits.

       --version
               Displays information about the currently installed version
               and exits.
