Description: # pyfpds
        pyfpds is a basic python wrapper for accessing federal contracting data in the Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS). The only programmatic access to this data is via an ATOM feed that limits each request to 10 records. This can be quite frustrating if you want more than 10 records! This library will grab up to any number of records requested (the default being 100) and compile them into one data structure. Subsequently, the performance is not exemplary, as much of the processing time is spent in http transport. However, if you have the time, it makes life a bit easier :). The default order of records returned is by `SIGNED_DATE` in descending order (in other words, the most recently signed contract actions come first).
