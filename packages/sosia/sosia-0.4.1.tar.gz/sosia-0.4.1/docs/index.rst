Match Authors in Scopus automatically with sosia
================================================

sosia (Italian for *doppelgänger*) finds researchers that are similar to another one. Use the matching researcher as a control in Diff-in-Diff anlyses. sosia is developed and `described <https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3742602>`_ by econometricians for scientists of science.

sosia does not pre-compute annual characteristics to find controls. Instead, sosia searches the entire Scopus database via `pybliometrics <https://pybliometrics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_. Configure both--and let sosia find a match for you.

=======
Example
=======

Install sosia from PyPI using the console or command line interpreter:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install sosia

In Python, set up sosia (and eventually pybliometrics) and search for similar scientists using their Scoups Author Profile IDs.

.. include:: ../README.rst
  :start-after: inclusion-marker-start
  :end-before: inclusion-marker-end

If sosia helped you getting data for research, please cite our corresponding paper:

* Rose, Michael E. and Stefano H. Baruffaldi: "`Finding Doppelgängers in Scopus: How to Build Scientists Control Groups Using Sosia <https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=3742602>`_", Max Planck Institute for Innovation & Competition Research Paper No. 20-20.

Citing the paper helps the development of sosia, because it justifies funneling resources into the development.  It also signals that you created your control group in a transparent and replicable way.
