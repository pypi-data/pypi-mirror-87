        ## Introduction
        
        Liking and following automatically on your Android phone/tablet. No root required: it works on [uiautomator2](https://github.com/openatx/uiautomator2), which is a faster and more efficient fork of the official Android UI testing framework [UI Automator](https://developer.android.com/training/testing/ui-automator). 
        
        This is a completely free and open source project that is forked from the freemium project [Insomniac](https://github.com/alexal1/Insomniac/). This project started when they decided to do a controversial monetization strategy where they removed previously free features and encrypted their code. Since then we’ve significantly improved their codebase in many ways. We’ve also been adding countless new features and other improvements. 
        
        Why use us over them? Well, we're completely free and offer many of their "premium" features for free. We left their project when they became more focused on money than on keeping the project free and open. Now they claim to be free and open source, but when you look closer; you see differently. We're different and arguably better in every way.
