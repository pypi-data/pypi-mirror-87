Description: # Workflow module
        
        ## Description
        
        The Workflow module manages a sequence, ie a list of steps which are linked together in a sequential way.  
        To define such a sequence, create a table in excel or csv file with columns named:
        - stepId
        - title
        - nexts
        
        **stepId** is the unique step identifier,  
        **title** is an arbitrary name of the step,  
        **nexts** is a list of stepIds that follows the step. The list is given by stepIds separated with '-' .
        
        Here is an example:  
        
        |stepId|title|nexts|
        |---|:---:|---:|
        |1|my first step|2-3|
        |2|my second step|4|
        |3|step 3!|12|
        |4|step4||
        |9|step9|12-4|
        |12|step12||
          
        In this example, steps 1 and 9 are the first steps in the workflow because the don't have any previous step.  
        Steps 4 and 12 are the last steps because they don't have any next step.  
        - Step 1 points to 2 next steps: steps 2 and 3,
        - Step 2 points to step 4, ...  
        
        
        As we can see, there is no need to define a continuous suite fo stepIds and the identifiers don't need to be sorted. 
        
        ## Basic call example
        ```python
        import pandas as pd
        from pycroaktools.workflow.workflow import Workflow
        workflow = Workflow(pd.read_csv('workflow.csv'), 'myWorkflow') #read_csv may be replaced by read_excel
        paths = workflow.getAllPaths()
        for path in paths:
            for step in path:
                print(step.stepId)
        ```
