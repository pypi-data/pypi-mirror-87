Nagios Remote Data Protocol Daemon
==================================

The ``nrdpd`` program is used as a passive monitoring agent for Nagios.  It
will use regular Nagios plugins to perform system checks and submit those
results to your monitoring server(s) via the NRDP protocol.

This package contains both the ``nrdpd`` service and a Python library that
you can integrate with.


The full `documentation`_ has details on the API as well as configuration.
