        # ITechPSP payment page SDK
        
        This is a set of libraries in the Python language to ease integration of your service
        with the ITechPSP Payment Page.
        
        Please note that for correct SDK operating you must have at least Python 3.5.  
        
        ## Payment flow

        ## Installation
        
        Install with pip
        ```bash
        pip install itechpsp-sdk
        ```
        
        ### Get URL for payment
        
        ```python
        from payment_page_sdk.gate import Gate
        from payment_page_sdk.payment import Payment
        
        gate = Gate('secret')
        payment = Payment('402')
        payment.payment_id = 'some payment id'
        payment.payment_amount = 1001
        payment.payment_currency = 'USD'
        payment_url = gate.get_purchase_payment_page_url(payment)
        ``` 
        
        `payment_url` here is the signed URL.
        
        ### Handle callback from ITechPSP
        
        You'll need to autoload this code in order to handle notifications:
        
        ```python
        from payment_page_sdk.gate import Gate
        
        gate = Gate('secret')
        callback = gate.handle_callback(data)
        ```
        
        `data` is the JSON data received from payment system;
        
        `callback` is the Callback object describing properties received from payment system;
        `callback` implements these methods: 
        1. `callback.get_payment_status()`
            Get payment status.
        2. `callback.get_payment()`
            Get all payment data.
        3. `callback.get_payment_id()`
            Get payment ID in your system.
