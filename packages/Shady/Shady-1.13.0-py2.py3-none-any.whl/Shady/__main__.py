"""
On its own, `python -m Shady` starts an interactive prompt, in a subsidiary
thread, with the `Shady` package already imported and in which any construction
and running of a `Shady.World` will be redirected to the main thread. This is
part of the functionality of the `run` subcommand, which is assumed by default.
More generally,
::

	python -m Shady SUBCOMMAND [...]

can be used to invoke one of the following behaviors according to the
specified `SUBCOMMAND`:

`demo`

	The syntax::
	
		python -m Shady demo SCRIPT_NAME [...]
	
	starts a subsidiary thread, which will either interpret the specified
	script, or start an interactive prompt if `SCRIPT_NAME` is omitted.
	Construction and running of a `Shady.World` in that script/session
	will be redirected to the main thread.  This allows Shady to be
	tested or interactively explored in a multi-threaded environment,
	even on platforms that would not allow the `Shady.World` to run in
	a subsidiary thread (see `Shady.Documentation.Concurrency` for more
	details).

	The interpreter will stop and print a preview of each annotated section
	of code , and allow input from an interactive prompt. By default, the
	third-party package `IPython` is used to implement the prompt, if it
	is available. You can explicitly force the use of a vanilla (non-
	IPython) prompt if you add the option `--console=Python` on the command
	line. Or you can disable previewing and interaction completely by saying
	`--console=None` (this makes the `demo` subcommand identical to the
	`run` subcommand).

	If `SCRIPT_NAME` does not directly indicate an existing file, but the
	`examples/` subdirectory of the Shady package directory contains a
	script of the specified name (plus the `.py` extension if `SCRIPT_NAME`
	does not already have it) then the corresponding example script will
	be run.  This means you can say, for example::

		python -m Shady demo showcase

	and the script  `<path-to-Shady>/examples/showcase.py` will be used.

	Additional command-line options are interpreted by the specified script
	itself.  For example, most of the bundled example scripts respond to
	the `--help` option which will cause them to list their other options.


`run`

	This is the same as the `demo` subcommand except that the `--console`
	option will default to `None` for script handling. If no `SCRIPT_NAME`
	is supplied, an interactive prompt will be opened in a subsidiary
	thread.  If `SCRIPT_NAME` is specified, a subsidiary thread will be
	used to interpret the script (looking in the Shady package's
	`examples/` subdirectory to match the filename if not otherwise found)
	but with no previewing and no prompt.  In either case, construction
	and running of a `Shady.World` will be redirected to the main thread.
	
	The `run` subcommand is assumed by default, so the following are
	equivalent to each other:

		python -m Shady showcase
		python -m Shady run showcase

	and by the same token, `python -m Shady` is the same as
	`python -m Shady run`.

	Note: if Shady opens a full-screen window blocking your console,
	you should still be able to alt-tab (or command-tab) away. Timing
	performance will likely be poorer while the Shady window is in the
	background.  Also, unless the default event-handling behavior is
	overridden, Shady windows can be closed and the engine terminated
	by pressing either the `q` or the `escape` key.

	
`list`

	Lists the names of the available example scripts.
	
	
`screens`

	Lists details of the available display devices.
	
	
`timings`

	The syntax::

		python -m Shady timings LOG_FILE_NAME

	uses `Shady.PlotTimings` to plot a timing analysis based on the
	specified log file (created by passing the `logfile` option to some
	previous `World`'s constructor).
	
	
`help`

	`python -m Shady help`  displays the documentation you are reading
	now, and exits. But you presumably already know this.
	
	`python -m Shady help EXAMPLE_NAME`  is equivalent to
	`python -m Shady run EXAMPLE_NAME --help`. Either of these will
	print the documentation for the named example script, and exit.

	You can also request help on a class, function or topic::
	
		python -m Shady help World
		python -m Shady help BackEnd
		python -m Shady help PropertySharing
	
	The last one is the name of a "topic"---these are all symbols
	inside the `Shady.Documentation` sub-module, and one of them is,
	itself, a list of topics: `python -m Shady help Topics`


`version` and `versions`

	`python -m Shady version` displays the version number of the
	Shady Python package.  The `versions` subcommand displays more
	in-depth information.
