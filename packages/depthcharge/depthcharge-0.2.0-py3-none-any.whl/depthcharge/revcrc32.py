    "Reverses" a CRC32 operation computed over a 4-byte (32-bit) input.

    This implementation  is just a simplification of Listing 6 from the
    following paper.  We're basically trying to compute a chosen CRC32 by
    "appending" 4 bytes to a zero-length input.

    object is returned, converted per the specified `endianness` value.
