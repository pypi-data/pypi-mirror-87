            * Access token hash.
            
            * Provides validation that the access token is tied to the identity token.
            
            * If the ID token is issued with an access token in the server flow, this is always included.
            
            * This can be used as an alternate mechanism to protect against cross-site request forgery attacks, but if you follow Step 1 and Step 3 it is not necessary to verify the access token.
        
        email_verified (bool)
        
            * True if the user's e-mail address has been verified; otherwise false.

            * This may be the case at Google for hybrid apps where a web application and Android app have a different client_id but share the same project.
        
        email (str):
        
            * The user's email address.
            
            * This may not be unique and is not suitable for use as a primary key.
            
            * Provided only if your scope included the string "email".
        
        profile (str):

            * Note that this claim is never guaranteed to be present.
        
        picture (str):
