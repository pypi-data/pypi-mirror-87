The following three sub-directories contain the results obtained 
using the RPG module:

   mondrian

   color_blobs

   wallpic2

All you have to do is to execute

   selective_search.py

that is already included in the respective directories.

For classroom presentation, make sure that you set the constructor parameter

   image_size_reduction_factor

so that the number of nodes in the initial graph does not exceed around 3500
in order to get the results back in a reasonable length of time.
