        <strong>Kadi4Mat</strong> is the <strong>Karlsruhe Data Infrastructure for Materials Science</strong>, a
        software for managing research data with the aim of combining new concepts with established technologies and
        existing solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
        The aim of this project is to combine the ability to manage and exchange data (the <em>Repository</em>) with the
        possibility to analyze, visualize and transform said data (the <em>Electronic Lab Notebook</em>). The latter is
        made possible by employing a modular architecture, which allows to cover the specific needs of different
        scientists each utilizing unique workflows, while also opening the possibility to easily branch out into other
        disciplines in the future. Eventually, the goal is to cover the whole scientific workflow of day to day
        research, starting from the creation of data, including interfacing with devices for experimenters, up to the
        publishing of the data as well as corresponding results.
      </p>
      <p>
        Kadi4Mat is being developed as part of several research projects at the
