"""This module contains all of the unit tests for the project. It is run automatically by github
when a pr is submitted/updated. It can also be manually run. To run all tests use ```python -m unittest
discover tests```. If you have a specific test to run, then use ```python -m tests.test_testname```

### Naming Convention
All tests in this file are named test_testname.py with the testname being something relating to the
module it is testing
