        # ads2inspire
        Replace ADS citations with the appropriate INSPIRE ones in latex and bibtex
        
        Why? Because ADS citation keys are not stable: they start out as something like `2019arXiv191207609s`,
        and after being accepted to a journal turn into something like `2020PhRvD.101f4007S`. This means you
        have to rewrite your latex, or you might even end up citing both entries!
        
        ## Installation
        
        ### From PyPI
        
        In your Python environment run
        
        ```
        python -m pip install ads2inspire
        ```
        
        ### From conda-forge
        
        In your conda environment run
        
        ```
        conda install -c conda-forge ads2inspire
        ```
        
        ### From this repository
        
        In your Python environment from the top level of this repository run
        
        ```
        python -m pip install .
        ```
        
        ### From GitHub
        
        In your Python environment run
        
        ```
        python -m pip install "git+https://github.com/duetosymmetry/ads2inspire.git#egg=ads2inspire"
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        First latex/bibtex/latex your file, then run
        
        ```shell
        ads2inspire [--backup] [--filter-type [ads|all]] [--fill-missing] auxfile.aux [texfile1.tex [texfile2.tex [...]]]
        ```
        
        If your main tex file is named `wonderful.tex`, then your auxfile will be named `wonderful.aux`.
        `ads2inspire` will read the aux file, query INSPIRE, then rewrite all the texfiles named on the
        command line, and append to the first bibtex file named in auxfile.  The option `--backup` will
        make the program write backups of the tex and bib files before rewriting them.  The option
        `--filter-type` controls which keys to search for on INSPIRE: the default `"ads"` will only
        search for keys that look like ADS keys, while `"all"` will try all keys (aside from those that
        look like INSPIRE keys).
        The `--fill-missing` flag will query for INSPIRE-like keys that were
        referenced in the LaTeX source, but missing from the .bib file, and
        fill them into the .bib file if found.

        Note that I have done very little testing! Want to pitch in and help make this code better?
        Please fork and send me PRs!
        
        TODO:
        - More testing
        - More filter types
        - more?
        
        ## Citation
