Announcements
=============

-   Work has began! Dec 4th

Installation 
============

LogReader is going to be distribute via PyPi and as the content store grows we can expand it to other pieces of software
making it accessible to all regardless of what you use. Alternatively, you could have a glance at the source code and copy/paste
it yourself.


Structure of LogReader
=======================

Currently, the main subpackages are:

- **logreader**: logreader main class. 


Genesis
=======

LogReader was created because I noticed I was using the same variable across multiple scripts and figure it would be useful
for folk to have.
