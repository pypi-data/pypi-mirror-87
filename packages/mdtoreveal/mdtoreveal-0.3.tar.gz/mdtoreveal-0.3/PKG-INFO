Description: # mdtoreveal
        
        It's an extremly basic
        [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) to
        [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/) conversion tool.
        
        Yes reveal already supports Markdown, but it needs specifically
        crafted Markdown with strange separators which I don't personally
        like. And yes you can also do this using pandoc but it mess with
        syntax highlighting by handling it.
        
        ## Usage
        
            mdtoreveal my_prez.md --output my_prez.html
        
        It's also allowed to skip the output file, so its name is guessed, the
        previous command is equivalent to the following one:
        
            mdtoreveal my_prez.md
        
        ## Syntax
        
        Let's start with pure Markdown:
        
            # Big titles makes reveal.js "columns"
        
            ## Sub titles make reveal.js "slides" inside columns.
        
            ```python
            print("Syntax highlighting works")
            ```
        
            ::: notes
        
            Look, this is a personal note, it's not mandatory to use them, but you still can.
            Everything betwen `::: notes` and the next slide is only visible by the presenter.
        
            ## 2nd slide
        
            Blah blah …
        
        ## Configuration
        
        There's not, deal with it, don't loose your time on fine-tuning, and
        focus on your presentation.
        
        Still, you prefer a dark theme? It's unreadable on video projectors,
        keep this one, trust me.
        
        You want bigger code blocks? You already have 12 lines and 61 columns,
        if you stuff more, it won't be readable anyway, stick to it.
        
        You want a bigger font for your code blocks, so it's still readable
        from the end of the room? I can understand that, I used to use a
        bigger one too, let's talk in the issues.
        
        
        ## You're using a Makefile?
        
        Me too ♥ this should do:
        
        ```Makefile
        SRCS := $(wildcard *.md)
        HTML := $(SRCS:.md=.html)
        
        .PHONY: static
        static: $(HTML)
        
        %.html: %.md
        	mdtoreveal $< -o $@
        ```
