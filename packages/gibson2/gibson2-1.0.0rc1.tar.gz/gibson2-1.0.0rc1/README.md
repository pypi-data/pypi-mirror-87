### Large Scale Interactive Simulation Environments for Robot Learning

iGibson, the Interactive Gibson Environment, is a simulation environment providing fast visual rendering and physics simulation (based on Bullet). It is packed with a dataset with hundreds of large 3D environments reconstructed from real homes and offices, and interactive objects that can be pushed and actuated. iGibson allows researchers to train and evaluate robotic agents that use RGB images and/or other visual sensors to solve indoor (interactive) navigation and manipulation tasks such as opening doors, picking and placing objects, or searching in cabinets.

### Latest Updates

[12/1/2020] Major update to iGibson to reach iGibson v1.0, for details please refer to our [technical report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.02924). 

- Release of iGibson dataset, which consists of 15 fully interactive scenes and 500+ object models.
- New features of the Simulator: Physically based rendering; 1-beam and 16-beam lidar simulation; Domain
 randomization support.
- Code refactoring and cleanup. 

[05/14/2020] Added dynamic light support :flashlight:

[04/28/2020] Added support for Mac OSX :computer:

### Release
This is the repository for iGibson (pip package `gibson2`) 1.0 release. Bug reports, suggestions for improvement, as
 well as community
 developments are encouraged and appreciated. The support for our previous version of the environment, [Gibson
  Environment
 ](http://github.com/StanfordVL/GibsonEnv/), will be moved to this repository.

### Documentation
The documentation for this repository can be found here: [iGibson Environment Documentation](http://svl.stanford.edu/igibson/docs/). It includes installation guide (including data download), quickstart guide, code examples, and APIs.

### Dowloading Dataset of 3D Environments
There are several datasets of 3D reconstructed large real-world environments (homes and offices) that you can download and use with iGibson. All of them will be accessible once you fill in this <a href="https://forms.gle/36TW9uVpjrE1Mkf9A" target="_blank">[form]</a>.

Additionally, with iGibson v1.0 release, you will have access to 15 fully interactive scenes (100+ rooms) that can be
 used in simulation. As a highlight, here
 are the features we support. We also include 500+ object models.  

- Scenes are the
 result of converting 3D reconstructions of real homes into fully interactive simulatable environments.
- Each scene corresponds to one floor of a real-world home.
The scenes are annotated with bounding box location and size of different objects, mostly furniture, e.g. cabinets, doors, stoves, tables, chairs, beds, showers, toilets, sinks...
- Scenes include layout information (occupancy, semantics)
- Each scene's lighting effect is designed manually, and the texture of the building elements (walls, floors, ceilings
) is baked offline with high-performant ray-tracing
- Scenes are defined in iGSDF (iGibson Scene Definition Format), an extension of URDF, and shapes are OBJ files with
 associated materials
