[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://bit.ly/omnizart-colab)\n\nA quick-start example is as following:\n``` bash\n# Install omnizart\npip install omnizart\n\n# Download the checkpoints after installation\nomnizart download-checkpoints\n\n# Now it's ready for the transcription~\nomnizart drum transcribe <path/to/audio.wav>\nomnizart chord transcribe <path/to/audio.wav>\nomnizart music transcribe <path/to/audio.wav>\n```\n\nOr use the docker image:\n```\ndocker pull mctlab/omnizart:latest\ndocker run -it mctlab/omnizart:latest bash\n```\n\nComprehensive usage and API references can be found in the [official documentation site](https://music-and-culture-technology-lab.github.io/omnizart-doc/).\n\n# About\n[Music and Culture Technology Lab (MCTLab)](https://sites.google.com/view/mctl/home) aims to develop technology for music and relevant applications by leveraging cutting-edge AI techiniques.\n\n# Plan to support\n| Commands         | transcribe         | train              | evaluate | Description                       |\n|------------------|--------------------|--------------------|----------|-----------------------------------|\n| music            | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: |          | Transcribes notes of instruments. |\n| drum             | :heavy_check_mark: | :interrobang:      |          | Transcribes drum tracks.          |\n| vocal            |                    |                    |          | Transcribes pitch of vocal.       |\n| vocal-contour    |                    |                    |          | Transcribes contour of vocal.     |\n| chord            | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: |          | Transcribes chord progression.    |\n| beat             |                    |                    |          | Transcribes beat position.        |\n\n**NOTES** Though the implementation of training the drum model is 90% complete, but there still exists some\ninvisible bugs that cause the training fails to converge compared to the author's original implementation.\n\nExample usage\n<pre>\nomnizart music transcribe <i>path/to/audio</i>\nomnizart chord transcribe <i>path/to/audio</i>\nomnizart drum transcribe <i>path/to/audio</i>\n</pre>\n\nFor training a new model, download the dataset first and follow steps described below.\n<pre>\n# The following command will default saving the extracted feature under the same folder,\n# called <b>train_feature</b> and <b>test_feature</b>\nomnizart music generate-feature -d <i>path/to/dataset</i>\n\n# Train a new model\nomnizart music train-model -d <i>path/to/dataset</i>/train_feature --model-name My-Model\n</pre>\n\n\n# Development\nDescribes the neccessary background of how to develop this project.\n\n## Download and install\n``` bash\ngit clone https://github.com/Music-and-Culture-Technology-Lab/omnizart.git\n\n# Install dependenies. For more different installation approaches, please refer to the official documentation page.\n# The following command will download the checkpoints automatically.\ncd omnizart\nmake install\n\n# For developers, you have to install Dev dependencies as well, since they will not be installed by default.\npoetry install\n```\n\n## Package management\nUses [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for package management, instead of writing `requirements.txt` and `setup.py` manually.\nWe still provide the above two files for convenience. You can also generate them by executing ``make export``.\n\n### ATTENTION! MUST SEE!\nThere is a major difference between install with `poetry install` and `python setup.py install`. When using poetry for installation, which\nis the default approach when running `make insatll`, the site-pacakges and resource files are placed in the **current** folder.\nThis is different from executing `python setup.py install`, which resource files are installed in where a normal package you download through `pip install` will be placed (e.g. ~/.local/lib/python3.6/site-packages) .\n\nAnd why things aren't placed in the normal path, but the command still can be executed? The answer is that poetry add an additional package path to your *PATH*  environment variable, and guess what is that path? Bingo! Your current path where you can execute `poetry install`! The difference has a major impact on running `omnizart download-checkpoints`. The default save path of checkpoints is to where omnizart being installed. That would be fine for end users, but not good news for developers though. That means after you git clone this project, and installed with `setup.py` approach, the **checkpoints are stored under ~/.local/.../site-packages/**, not your current development path. Therefore, it is strongly suggested that developers should use the default installation approach for a more comfortable developing experience^^.\n\nFeedback: what a big trap there is...\n\n\n## Documentation\nAutomatically generate documents from inline docstrings of module, class, and function. \n[Hosted document page](http://140.109.21.96:8000/build/html/index.html)\n\nDocumentation style: Follows `numpy` document flavor. Learn more from [numpydoc](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html).\n\nDocument builder: [sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/)\n\nTo generate documents, `cd docs/` and execute `make html`. To see the rendered results, run `make serve` and view from the browser.\nAll documents and docstrings use **reStructured Text** format. More informations about this format can be found from \n[Sphinx's Document](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html).\n\n## Linters\nUses flake8 and pylint for coding style check.\n\nTo check with linters, execute `make check`.\n\nYou don't have to achieve a perfect score on pylint check, just pass 9.5 points still counted as a successful check.\n\n### Caution!\nThere is convenient make command for formating the code, but it should be used very carefully.\nNot only it could format the code for you, but also could mess up the code, and eventually you should still need\nto check the format manually after refacorting the code with tools. \n\nTo format the code with black and yapf, enter `make format`.\n\n## Unittest\nUses `pytest` for unittest. The overall coverage rate should pass 25%, or CI would fail.\n\n## CI/CD\nUses github actions for automatic linting, unittesting, document building, and package release.\nCurrently supports two workflows:\n* General check\n* Documentation page publishing\n* Publish PyPI package and docker image\n\n### General Check\nEverytime you push to the master branch, file a pull request, and merge into master branch, will trigger\nthis action. This will do checks like code format, and unittests by leveraging the above mentioned\ntools. If the check fails, you will not be able to merge the feature branch into master branch.\n\n### Documentation Page Publishing\nWe use [github page](https://pages.github.com/) to host our documentation, and is separated as an [independent\nrepository](https://github.com/Music-and-Culture-Technology-Lab/omnizart-doc). \n\n**Please do not directly modify the content of the omnizart-doc repository!!**\n\nThe only permitted way to update the documentation page is by updating the `build_doc` branch, and\nlet the workflow do the rest of things.\n\nSteps to update the documentation page:\n* Clone **this** repo\n* Create a new branch. **DO NOT UPDATE THE `build_doc` BRANCH DIRECTLY!!**\n* File a pull request\n* Merge into master (by admin)\n* Merge into `build_doc` branch (by admin)\n* Push to this repo (by admin)\n\n### Publish PyPI Package and Docker Image\nPublish the python package to PyPI and also the docker image to dockerhub when push tags to the repository.\nThe publish process will be automatically done by the github actions. There are several steps in the process:\n\n1. Pack and publish the python package.\n2. Build the docker image and publish to Docker Hub.\n3. Create release -> this will also trigger the automation of documentation publishment.\n\n\n## Docker\nWe provide both the Dockerfile for local image build and also the pre-build image on Docker Hub.\n\nTo build the image, run the following:\n```\ndocker build -t omnizart:my-image .\n```\n\nTo use the pre-build image, follow below steps:\n```\n# Download from Docker Hub\ndocker pull mctlab/omnizart\n\n# Execute the image\ndocker run -it mctlab/omnizart:latest\n\n### For those who want to leverage the power of GPU for acceleration, make sure\n### you have installed docker>=19.03 and the 'nvidia-container-toolkit' package.\n# Execute the docker with GPU support\ndocker run --gpus all -it mctlab/omnizart:latest\n```\n\n\n## Command Test\nTo actually install and test the `omnizart` command, execute `make install`. This will automatically create a virtual environment and install everything needed inside it. After installation, just follow the instruction showing on the screen to activate the environment, then type `omnizart --help` to check if it works. After testing the command, type `deactivate` to leave the virtual environment.\n\n## Others\n### Log Level\nThe default log level is set to `warn`. You can change it by exporting environment variable *LOG_LEVEL* to one of `debug`, `info`, `warning`, `error`, or `critical`. The verbosity is sorted from high to low (debug -> critical). For the consideration behind the log level design, please refer to the [soruce code](https://github.com/Music-and-Culture-Technology-Lab/omnizart/blob/master/omnizart/utils.py#L20) or the [documentation page](https://music-and-culture-technology-lab.github.io/omnizart-doc/utils.html#omnizart.utils.get_logger)\n",
