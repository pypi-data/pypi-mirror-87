    [`bug 1813739 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystonemiddleware/+bug/1813739>`_]
    When admin identity endpoint is not created yet, keystonemiddleware emit
    EndpointNotFound exception. Even after admin identity endpoint created,
    auth_token middleware could not be notified of update since it does not
    invalidate existing auth. Add an invalidation step so that endpoint
    updates can be detected.
