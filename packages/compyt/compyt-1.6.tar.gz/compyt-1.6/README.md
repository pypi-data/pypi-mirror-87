# Complex Numbers for Pytorch

A simple complex number module for Pytorch. Complex tensors are formed by concatenating the real and imaginary fields along the last dimension. Supports complex multiplication, division, exponentiation, absolute value, squared absolute value, and conjugate. Further, several functions for converting between Numpy complex numbers and Pytorch complex tensors are made available.
