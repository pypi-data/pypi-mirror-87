deprecations:
  - |
    The configuration option ``idle_timeout`` is now deprecated and has been
    renamed to  ``connection_recycle_time``, including within the main oslo.db
    options, as well as in the keyword arguments to
    ``engines.create_engine()``, ``enginefacade.configure()`` and
    ``enginefacade.configure_defaults()``. The new name more accurately
    describes what this option does, in that it is not directly related to the
    "idle" time of the connection itself, nor is the connection disconnected at
    any specific time.  It refers to a rule stating that any connection which
    has been present more than N seconds as a member of the connection pool
    will be automatically discarded and replaced the next time it is checked
    out from the pool.
