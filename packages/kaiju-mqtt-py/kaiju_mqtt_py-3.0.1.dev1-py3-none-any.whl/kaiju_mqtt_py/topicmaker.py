        Make a topic based on the Netflix MQTT topic protocol.

        This is an OPTIONAL call that can help you form the proper request for most conditions where you
        are interacting with the Netflix request/response protocol. If you want to hard-code your topic forming,
        you are free to, but you're getting the phone call when it goes wrong.

        The topic structure is influenced by:
        whether the client is attached to a cloud or local broker
        whether the destination is one of a few defined types
        whether the destination topic is for a response, request, handler, or just general pubsub
        which direction a request is flowing (captured in destination types)
