        Solves the traveling salesperson problem (TSP) using two-opt swaps to untangle a route. Does so in a way which
        is convenient for quickly accessing the beginning of the sorted list, as t_step is used to periodically advance
        the first index which can be moved by the sort

        Parameters
        ----------
        initial_route: ndarray
            [optional] route to initialize search with. Note that the first position in the route is fixed, but all others
            may vary. If no route is provided, the initial route is the same order the distances array was constructed with.
        epsilon: float
            exit tolerence on relative improvement. 0.01 corresponds to 1%
        t_step: float
            average time after which to advance an index. A single step can easily be longer if the nested for loop
            takes a considerable amount of time, after which multiple indices will be moved to the 'sorted' route to
            catch up.
        distances: ndarray
            distance array, which distances[i, j] is the distance from the ith to the jth point
        og_distance: float
            path-length of initial_route
