        ### Installation:
        Installation is easy!
        ```
        $ pip install VSColab
        ```
        Using this package we can ssh into the Google Colab instance and also perform remote developement using VSCode.
        
        ### Getting Started:
        - Install the package
        - Use the `Connect()` function to create an Ngrok tunnel, by passing a password string as a parameter.
        - Then Enter the Authentication Key (which can be obtained from:https://dashboard.ngrok.com/auth/your-authtoken) and press Enter.
        - Use the `VSconfig()` function to get the contents for the VSCode Config file, by passing the URL of the Ngrok tunnel (which can be obtained from: https://dashboard.ngrok.com/status/tunnels)
        - To kill the tunnel, use the `Kill()` function.
        
        ### Colab starter notebook:

        ### Remote development with VSCode:
        - First create a tunnel using the `Connect()` function.
        - Use the `VSconfig()` function to get the contents for the VSCode Config file, by passing the URL of the Ngrok tunnel (which can be obtained from: https://dashboard.ngrok.com/status/tunnels) and copy the Output.
        - Then install the **remote-ssh** plugin in VSCode, and click the button at the bottom left corner. 
        - Then select the __Open Configuration Files..__ option and enter the copied text there.
        - Then select the __Connect to Host..__ option and Enter the password when asked.
        - __Viola!! A fully functional Development environment powered by the GPU's and TPU's of Google Colab__
        
        
        ### Note:
        If the command `$ nvidia-smi` doesn't work in the ssh session, simple type :
        ```
        export LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib64-nvidia/libnvidia-ml.so
        ```
        Then press Enter.
