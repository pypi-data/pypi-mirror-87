* Tests init file can be empty
* Avoid local paths for dummy\_label json file
* Uncomment unit-tests and add \_\_init\_\_ file to test folder - Without all tests would fail
* Update annotations notebook
* Add sanity checks on types in lower\_bound
* Remove empty \_\_init\_\_ files
* Update backannotation tutorial
* Fix packaging for aedat\_to\_video
* Minor packaging refactor
* Move aedat\_to\_video inside cvat submodule - Can be used to build a video conversion script - Can be used directly in a notebook to perform video conversion
* Bugfix in loading polygon vertices - Improve unit-testing
* Update sample notebook
* Update dummy label to proper value
* Improve test coverage for loading annotations
* Splitting load\_annotation functions in separate file

* Rename dummy annotations file
* Name refactor - Rename 'load\_annotated' with 'aedat\_load\_annotated' - Renamed file backannotate to annotate\_aedat
* Refactor backannotate and provide notebook for easy testing and interaction
* Add dummy CVAT video annotation file in test folder
* First backannotation working draft - Use broadcast in lower\_bound - Add annotate\_events function
* Add \_\_init\_\_.py to aermanager folder
* Load labels from json file - Add unit test
* Load labels from CVAT Json file
* Add dummy CVAT labels
* Refactor lower\_bound
* Add test file for backannotation utility functions
* Add backannotation script from cvat-demo
* Adapt aedat\_convert\_to\_video to new aermanager API
* Copy aedat\_utils.py from cvat-demo repository
* Copy aedat\_to\_video.py from cvat-demo repository
* Update gitignore - .vscode config folder -  hdf5 files (maybe too harsh?) -  venv folder
