nMigen Yosys distribution
#########################

`nMigen <https://github.com/nmigen/nmigen>`_ is a Python-based hardware description language that uses `Yosys <http://www.clifford.at/yosys>`_ as a backend to emit Verilog.

The nMigen Yosys wheels provide a specialized `WebAssembly <https://webassembly.org/>`_ based build of Yosys that runs via `wasmtime-py <https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime-py>`_ if there is no system-wide Yosys installation, or if that installation is too old. This build is aggressively optimized for binary size and startup latency, and only includes features required by nMigen's Verilog and CXXRTL backends; it is not useful for any other purpose.

Although this package is platform-independent, it depends on wasmtime-py wheels, which are currently available only for x86_64 Windows, Linux, and macOS. This is expected to improve in the future.
