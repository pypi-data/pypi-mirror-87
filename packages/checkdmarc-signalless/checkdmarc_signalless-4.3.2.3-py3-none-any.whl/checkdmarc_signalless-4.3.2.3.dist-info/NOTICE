The original work belongs to https://github.com/domainaware/checkdmarc/
and was forked by me (DobroAlex@alexkoshernosigov@gmail.com)
on the 28th Nov 2020.

I'm trying to keep this project up to date with the original one.

The sole purpose of this project is to allow the usage of this package in
a multithreaded app. The original project lacks this ability due to the fact
it uses timeout_decorator (https://github.com/pnpnpn/timeout-decorator)
with signals and signals can not be used in a multithreaded application.

If you are having issues not related to the timeout please contact
the original repo.
