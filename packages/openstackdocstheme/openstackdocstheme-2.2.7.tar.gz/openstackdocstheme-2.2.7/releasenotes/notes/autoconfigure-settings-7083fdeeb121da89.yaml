    The following configuration variables, normally defined in ``conf.py``,
    can now be configured automatically.

    - ``project``
    - ``version``
    - ``release``
    - ``html_last_updated_fmt``
    - ``latex_engine``
    - ``latex_elements``

    It is not necessary to retain any configuration in ``conf.py`` and, in most
    cases, such configuration will be ignored. The sole exceptions to this rule
    are ``version`` and ``release`` which, if set to ``''`` will not be
    overridden. This allows for unversioned documentation.
