    Adds a caching layer.  The cache is a single JSON file created
    automatically in the user's home directory. It stores the parsed
    text data from all of the metadata input files in a file with a
    name based on the hash of the contents and `sys.path`, ensuring
    uniqueness for applications installed into different virtual
    environments.

    The type of the entry point objects returned has changed from
    `pkg_resources.EntryPoint` to `importlib.metadata.EntryPoint`. The
    new objects still have a `load()` method, but some of the other
    APIs are different.
