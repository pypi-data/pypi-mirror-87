Description: ucamcl
        ======
        
        This package provides a simple tool for checking answers
        to exercises in a Jupyter notebook.
        
        Usage::
        
          # Install the grader
          !pip install ucamcl
        
          # Log in to the grader. It will prompt you with a "log in" button.
          GRADER = ucamcl.autograder('https://markmy.solutions', course='scicomp').subsection('notes1')
        
          # Fetch a question. It will tell you what to do, with what parameters.
          q = GRADER.fetch_question('ex5')
          print(q)
        
          # Prepare your answer and submit it.
          myans = {'x': [i**2 for i in range(q['n'])]
          is_correct, answer = GRADER.submit_answer(q, myans)
        
        This package is what the student installs in their Jupyter notebook.
        The other half is a server that should be set up by the course instructor.
