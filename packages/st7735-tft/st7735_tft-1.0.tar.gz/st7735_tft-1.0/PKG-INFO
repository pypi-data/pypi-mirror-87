Description: # ST7735 TFT
        This python library is to interface with LCD displays based on the ST7735 chip.  
        It is based on [ST7735 by Pimoroni](https://github.com/pimoroni/st7735-python), but made to be faster when only updating a section of the screen.
        - Only updates the pixels that have changed since the last screen update
        - Can use `pigpio` or `RPi.GPIO` libraries
