"""
Implement classes to represent the progress of a task.

Use the ProgressbarText class for tasks that do not use multiprocessing,
and the ProgressbarMultiProcessServer class for tasks using
multiprocessing.

Basically, the task code must call the "progress" function to update the
progress bar and pass a number equivalent to the increment in the progress
since the last call. The progressbar must know the maximum value equivalent
to all the progress, which is passed during object creator for
ProgressbarText class.

The ProgressbarMultiProcessServer is similar to ProgressbarText class,
accounts for the progress of multiple processes. For each process you need
to call the register_client_and_get_proxy_progressbar to get a proxy
progressbar, where the maximum value equivalent to all the progress that
will be performed by that process is passed in this proxy creation. Each
process then calls the progress method of the proxy progressbar.

Note that there is also a DummyProgressbar whose progress function does
nothing. This is useful when you want to give the user a choice to show or
not the progressbar such that the task code can always call the progress
method and you only change the progressbar object.

    Base class for progressbars for distributed computations.

    In order to track the progress of distributed computations two classes

    proxy (the client) and is responsible to sending the current progress
    to the server. There will be one object of the "server class" and one

    of one of the distributed computations.

    This class is a base class for the "server part", while the
    :class:`ProgressbarDistributedClientBase` class is a base class for the
    "client part".

class ProgressbarMultiProcessServer(ProgressbarDistributedServerBase):
    """Class that prints a representation of the current progress of
    multiple process as text.

    While the :class:`ProgressbarText` class only tracks the progress of a
    single process, the :class:`ProgressbarMultiProcessServer` class can
    track the joint progress of multiple processes. This may be used, for
    instance, when you parallelize some task using the multiprocessing
    module.

    Using the ProgressbarMultiProcessServer class requires a little more work
    than using the ProgressbarText class, as it is described in the
    following:

     1. First you create an object of the ProgressbarMultiProcessServer class
        as usual. However, differently from the ProgressbarText class you
        don't pass the `finalcount` value to the progressbar yet.
     2. After that, for each process to be tracked, call the
        :meth:`register_client_and_get_proxy_progressbar` method passing
        the number equivalent to full progress for **that process**. This
        function returns a "proxy progressbar" that behaves like a regular
        ProgressbarText. Pass that proxy progressbar as an argument to that
        process so that it can call its "progress" method. Each process
        that calls the "progress" method of the received proxy progressbar
        will actually update the progress of the main
        ProgressbarMultiProcessServer object.
     3. Start all the processes and call the start_updater method of
        ProgressbarMultiProcessServer object so that the bar is updated by
        the different processes.
     4. After joining all the process (all work is finished) call the
        stop_updater method of the ProgressbarMultiProcessServer object.

    Parameters
    ----------
    progresschar : str
        Character used in the progressbar.
    message : str
        Message writen in the progressbar.
    sleep_time : float
        Time between progressbar updates (in seconds).
    filename : str
        If filename is None (default) then progress will be output to
        sys.stdout. If it is not None then the progress will be output
        to a file with name `filename`. This is usually useful for
        debugging and testing purposes.

class ProgressbarZMQServer(ProgressbarDistributedServerBase):
    """
    Distributed "server" progressbar using ZMQ sockets.

    In order to track the progress of distributed computations two classes
    are required, one that acts as a central point and is responsible to
    actually show the progress (the server), and other class that acts as a
    proxy (the client) and is responsible to sending the current progress
    to the server. There will be one object of the "server class" and one
    or more objects of the "client class", each one tracking the progress
    of one of the distributed computations.

    This class acts like the server. It creates a ZMQ socket which expects
    (string) messages in the form "client_id:current_progress", where the
    client_id is the ID of one client progressbar previously registered
    with the register_client_and_get_proxy_progressbar method while the
    current_progress is a "number" with the current progress of that
    client.

    Note that the client proxybar for this class is implemented in the
    ProgressbarZMQClient class.

    Parameters
    ----------
    progresschar : str
        Character used in the progressbar.
    message : str
        Message writen in the progressbar.
    sleep_time : float
        Time between progressbar updates (in seconds).
    filename : str
        If filename is None (default) then progress will be output to
        sys.stdout. If it is not None then the progress will be output to a
        file with name `filename`. This is usually useful for debugging and
        testing purposes.
    ip : IPAddress
        An string representing the address of the server socket.
        Ex: '192.168.0.117', 'localhost', etc.
    port : PortNumber
        The port to bind the socket.
