        ## He's Dead, Jim (Release 0.1)
        
        #### Scope
        
        For our first project we are tasked with building a command-line tool for finding and reporting dead links (e.g., broken URLs) in a file. Users might use the tool to help locate broken URLs in an HTML page, for example. The tool can be written in any programming language.
        
        #### How It Works
        
        He's Dead, Jim aggregates (a fancy word for saying _grabs_) all href tags on a single page/file and creates get requests for each link on the page. Those requests are then reported back to the user along with the status code and a delightful colour coded message indicating the status of each link.
        
        #### Optional Features
        
        He's Dead Jim features the following optional features:
        
        - Colourized output. Good URLs are printed in green, bad URLs are printed in red, and unknown URLs in gray.
        - -v can be supplied to the program for current version information.
        - Program incorporates multi-threading to allow for parallelization of the program.
        
        #### Usage
        
        Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) on your machine and reboot. Then:
        
        > git clone https://github.com/chrispinkney/He-s-Dead-Jim.git
        
        > cd He-s-Dead-Jim
        
        > pip install -r requirements.txt
        
        > python src/hdj.py
        
        #### Issues
