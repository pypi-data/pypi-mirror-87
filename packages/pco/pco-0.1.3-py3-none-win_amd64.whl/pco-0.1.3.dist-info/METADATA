The Python package **pco** offers all functions for working with pco cameras that are based
on the current SDK. All shared libraries for the communication with the
camera and subsequent image processing are included.

- Easy to use camera class
- Powerful API to `pco.software development kit <https://www.pco.de/fileadmin/user_upload/pco-manuals/pco.sdk_manual.pdf>`_
- Image recording and processing with `pco.recorder <https://www.pco.de/fileadmin/fileadmin/user_upload/pco-manuals/pco.recorder_manual.pdf>`_

Installation
============
Install from pypi (recommended)::

    $ pip install pco

Basic Usage
===========
.. code-block:: python

    import pco
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    with pco.Camera() as cam:

        cam.record()
        image, meta = cam.image()

        plt.imshow(image, cmap='gray')
        plt.show()

.. image:: https://www.pco.de/fileadmin/user_upload/company/screen.png

Logging
=======
To activate the logging output create the ``Camera`` object with
``debuglevel=`` parameter.

The debug level can be set to one of the following values:

- ``'off'`` Disables all output.
- ``'error'`` Shows only error messages.
- ``'verbose'`` Shows all messages.
- ``'extra verbose'`` Shows all messages and values.

The default debuglevel is ``'off'``.

.. code-block:: python

    pco.Camera(debuglevel='verbose')
    ...
    [][sdk] get_camera_type: OK.

The optional ``timestamp=`` parameter activates a tag in the printed output.
Possible values are: ``'on'`` and ``'off'``.

The default value is ``'off'``.

.. code-block:: python

    pco.Camera(debuglevel='verbose', timestamp='on')
    ...
    [2019-11-25 15:54:15.317855 / 0.016 s] [][sdk] get_camera_type: OK.


Documentation
=============

The pco.Camera class offers following methods:

- `record()`_ generates, configures and starts a new recorder instance.
- `stop()`_ stops the current recording.
- `close()`_ closes the current active camera and releases the blocked ressources.
- `image()`_ returns an image from the recorder as numpy array.
- `images()`_ returns all recorded images from the recorder as list of numpy arrays.
- `image_average()`_ returns the averaged image. This image is calculated from all recorded images in the buffer.
- `set_exposure_time()`_ sets the exposure time of the camera.
- `wait_for_first_image()`_ waits for the first available image in the recorder memory.

The pco.Camera class has the following variables:

- `configuration`_

The pco.Camera class has the following objects:

- `sdk`_ offers direct access to all underlying functions of the pco.sdk.
- `recorder`_ offers direct access to all underlying functions of the pco.recorder.


.. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

record()
--------

Creates, configures and starts a new recorder instance.

.. code-block:: python

    def record(self, number_of_images=1, mode='sequence'):

- ``number_of_images`` sets the number of images allocated in the driver. The RAM of the PC is limiting the maximum value.

- ``mode`` sets the type of recorder:

  - In ``'sequence'`` mode this function is blocking during record.
    The recorder stops automatically when the ``number_of_images`` is reached.

  - In ``'sequence non blocking'`` mode this function is non blocking.
    Status must be checked before reading an image. This mode is used
    to read images while recording, e.g. thumbnail.

  - In ``'ring buffer'`` mode this function is non blocking.
    Status must be checked before reading an image.
    Recorder did not stop the recording when the ``number_of_images`` is reached.
    The first image is overwritten from the next image.

  - In ``'fifo'`` mode this function is non blocking.
    Status must be checked before reading an image.
    When the ``number_of_images`` in the fifo is reached, the following images are dropped
    until images were read from the fifo.

The entire camera configuration must be set before calling ``record()``.
The ``set_exposure_time()`` command is the only exception. 
This function has no effect on the recorder object and can be called up during 
the recording.

.. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

stop()
------

Stops the current recording.

.. code-block:: python

    def stop(self):

In ``'ring buffer'`` and ``'fifo'`` mode this function must to be called by the user.
In ``'sequence'`` and ``'sequence non blocking'`` mode, this function is automatically called up
when the ``number_of_images`` is reached.


.. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

close()
-------
.. code-block:: python

    def close(self):

Closes the activated camera and releases the blocked ressources.
This function must be called before the application is terminated.
Otherwise the resources remain occupied.

This function is called automatically, if the camera object is
created by the ``with`` statement. An explicit call to ``close()`` is no
longer necessary.

.. code-block:: python

    with pco.Camera() as cam:
        # do some stuff


.. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

image()
-------

Returns an image from the recorder. The type of the image is a ``numpy.ndarray``.
This array is shaped depending on the resolution and ROI of the image.

.. code-block:: python

    def image(self, image_number=0, roi=None):

- ``image_number`` specifies the number of the image to read. In ``'sequence'`` or ``'sequence non blocking'`` mode the recorder
  index matches the image number.
  If ``image_number`` is set to ``0xFFFFFFFF`` the last recorded image is copied. This allows
  e.g. thumbnail while recording.

- ``roi`` sets the region fo interest. Only this region of the image is copied to the return value.

  .. code-block:: python

      >>> cam.record(number_of_images=1, mode='sequence')

      >>> image, meta = cam.image()

      >>> type(image)
      numpy.ndarray

      >>> image.shape
      (2160, 2560)

      >>> image, metadata = cam.image(roi=(1, 1, 300, 300))

      >>> image.shape
      (300, 300)

.. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

images()
--------

Returns all recorded images from the recorder as list of numpy arrays.

.. code-block:: python

    def images(self, roi=None, blocksize=None):

- ``roi`` sets the region fo interest. Only this region of the image is copied to the return value.

- ``blocksize`` defines the maximum number of images that are returned.
  This parameter is only useful in ``'fifo'`` mode and under special conditions.

  .. code-block:: python

      >>> cam.record(number_of_images=20, mode='sequence')

      >>> images, metadatas = cam.images()

      >>> len(images)
      20

      >>> for image in images:
      ...     print('Mean: {:7.2f} DN'.format(image.mean()))
      ...
      Mean: 2147.64 DN
      Mean: 2144.61 DN
      ...

     >>> images = cam.images(roi=(1, 1, 300, 300))

     >>> images[0].shape
    (300, 300)

.. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

image_average()
------------------------

Returns the averaged image. This image is calculated from all recorded images in the buffer.

.. code-block:: python

    def image_average(self, roi=None):

- ``roi`` defines the region fo interest. Only this region of the image is copied to the return value.

  .. code-block:: python

      >>> cam.record(number_of_images=100, mode='sequence')

      >>> avg = cam.image_average()

      >>> avg = cam.image_average(roi=(1, 1, 300, 300))

.. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

set_exposure_time()
-------------------

Sets the exposure time of the camera.

.. code-block:: python

    def set_exposure_time(self, exposure_time): 

- ``exposure_time`` must be given as float or integer value in the unit 'second'.
  The underlying values for the function ``sdk.set_delay_exposure_time(0, 'ms', time, timebase)``
  will be calculated automatically. The delay time is set to 0.

  .. code-block:: python

      >>> set_exposure_time(0.001)

      >>> set_exposure_time(1e-3)

.. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

wait_for_first_image()
-------------------------
Waits for the first available image in the recorder memory.

.. code-block:: python

    def wait_for_first_image(self):

In recorder mode ``'sequence non blocking'``, ``'ring buffer'`` and ``'fifo'``,
the function ``record()`` returns immediately.
It is the responsibility of the user to wait for images from the 
camera before calling ``image()``, ``images()`` or ``image_average``.

.. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

configuration
-------------

The camera parameters are updated by changing the ``configuration`` variable.

.. code-block:: python

    cam.configuration = {'exposure time': 10e-3,
                         'roi': (1, 1, 512, 512),
                         'timestamp': 'ascii',
                         'pixel rate': 100_000_000,
                         'trigger': 'auto sequence',
                         'acquire': 'auto',
                         'metadata': 'on',
                         'binning': (1, 1)}

The variable can only be changed before the ``record()`` function is called.
It's a dictionary with a certain number of entries.
Not all possible elements need to be specified. The following sample code only changes 
the ``'pixel rate'`` and does not affect any other elements of the configuration.


.. code-block:: python

    with pco.Camera() as cam:

        cam.configuration = {'pixel rate': 286_000_000}

        cam.record()
        ...

.. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------


sdk
---
The object ``sdk`` allows direct access to all underlying functions of the pco.sdk.

.. code-block:: python

       >>> cam.sdk.get_temperature()
       {'sensor temperature': 7.0, 'camera temperature': 38.2, 'power temperature': 36.7}

All return values form ``sdk`` functions are dictionarys.
Not all camera settings are currently covered by the ``camera`` class.
Special settings have to be set directly  by calling the respective SDK function.

.. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

recorder
--------

The object ``rec`` offers direct access to all underlying functions of the pco.recorder.
It is not necessary to call a recorder class method directly. 
All functions are fully covered by the methods of the ``camera`` class.
