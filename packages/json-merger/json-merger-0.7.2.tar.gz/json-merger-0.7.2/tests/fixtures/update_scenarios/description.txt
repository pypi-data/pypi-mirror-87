In this suite we test the following workflow:
* A record harvested from source "A" is inserted into the database.
* The database record is annotaded via external sources (e.g. Catalogers).
* We receive an update from source "A" and we don't want to lose the annotated information.

The expected behavior is:
* Record order in list fields is given by the update.
  * Additions
  * Reorderings
  * _Deletions_ (In this case the Cataloger work would be lost)
* Any fields changed by the update are seen in the HEAD version.
* If a field was changed both in HEAD and in the update then raise a Conflict.
