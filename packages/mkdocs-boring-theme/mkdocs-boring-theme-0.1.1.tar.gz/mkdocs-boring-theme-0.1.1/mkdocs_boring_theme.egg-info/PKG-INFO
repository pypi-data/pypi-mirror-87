Description: # MkDocs Boring Theme
        
        This is the MkDocs Boring Theme.
        It is based on the CSS framework [Min](http://mincss.com) which claims to be one of the slimmest but also one of the most compatible CSS frameworks.
        
        Check out the demo page to get a feeling of this theme.
        
        
        ## Goal
        
        The goal is to provide a lightweight theme which still does not look too awkward.
        *Min* promotes itself as being only 995 bytes, which is hard to challenge.
        
        It's ultimately small size requires a few overwriting features which can be found in `css/boring.css`.
        
        
        ## Todo List
        
        This theme is a work in progress. It lacks a few features, which I try to list here
        
        * Proper looking content navigation
        * Functioning search
        * Nested menus with dropdown effects
        * Minimizing `css/boring.css`
