        Machine and Deep Learning tools.
        
        ============
        Installation
        ============
        
        .. code-block::
        
            pip3 install DUlib --user
        
        -----
        Notes
        -----
        
        DUlib assumes that you have installed your desired version (e.g., cpu vs. gpu)
        of the `torch <https://pypi.org/project/torch/>`_ package as well as the `torchvision <https://pypi.org/project/torchvision/>`_ package.
        
        Similarly, a modern version of `matplotlib <https://pypi.org/project/matplotlib/>`_ is
        assumed to have been installed on your system.  Matplotlib is required solely for (optional) display
        of a real-time graph while training and for various demos; additionally, a running X server is required.
        
        To upgrade to the newest release of DUlib in the presence of a previously installed one, issue the command::
        
            pip3 install -U DUlib --user
        
        DUlib's documentation is read via a retooling of pydoc3 that includes custom highlighting. Issue the
        following command to check that your terminal accepts escape sequences compatible with DUlib's syntax
        highlighting and, if necessary, read notes on troubleshooting::
        
            pd du.highlight
        
        If all is well, read introductory usage remarks with the command::
        
            pd du
        
        See the `upstream repo <https://github.com/sj-simmons/DUlib>`_ for detailed installation and trouble-shooting
        notes as well as release information.
