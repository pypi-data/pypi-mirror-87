Django Bread
============

Django Bread is a Django app to help build BREAD (Browse, Read, Edit,
Add, Delete) views for Django models.

It helps with default templates, url generation, permissions, filters,
pagination, and more.

This is relatively stable. We're using it in production and have attempted
to document the important parts, but feedback is welcome.

Breaking change in 1.0.0
------------------------

Version 1.0.0 includes a breaking change! If you're using the default
view permissions, before upgrading, make sure you've
migrated your users and groups that have "read_{model_name}"
permissions to also have "view_{model_name}".  From 1.0.0 on, that's the
default permission a user needs to use the read views, because it's become the
standard Django permission for read-only access since Django 2.1.

If you're still on Django 2.0, don't upgrade django-bread until you
can get to at least Django 2.1. (Hopefully that's not the case, since
Django 2.0 has been out of support since April 1, 2019.)


Supported versions
------------------

Django: 2.2, 3.0, 3.1
Python: 3.7, 3.8, 3.9

For Python 2.7 and/or Django 1.11 support, the 0.5 release series is identical (features-wise)
to 0.6 and is available on PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/django-bread/#history

Testing
-------

To run the tests, install "tox" ("pip install tox") and just run it:

    $ tox
    ...
