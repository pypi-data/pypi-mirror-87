# konjingjing
A hyper-fast Python module for validating Thai Citizen Card ID written in Rust.

## Get Started
```bash
$ pip install konjingjing
```

```python
from konjingjing import verify_id

assert verify_id('1112034563562') # true
assert verify_id('11120345635') == False # false digit is less than 13
assert verify_id('1112034563s62') == False # false mix with alpha
```

## Notes ðŸ˜‹
This is my first python library written in rust. This is another weekend project.
