# About
ros_web_gui is a package for visualizing the available ROS nodes, topics, parameters and service
calls in a web browser. It provides much of the functionality that is also available with
the ROS command line tools and rqt_graph, but with a graphical user interface. When running
the ros_web_gui, a flask-based webserver will be started that can be accessed on port 5000.

# Installation
First, you should install ros on your machine. It is heavily recommened to use Ubuntu 20.04
or higher as ros-noetic is the first version with support for python3.

After installing ROS, you can install ros_web_gui via pip:
```
pip install ros_web_gui
```

When using the package from Github, you need the python packages pygraphviz, pyyaml and flask. So you can set up a conda env or virtual environment with

```
conda install flask pygraphviz pyyaml
```

OR

```
pip install flask pygraphviz pyyaml
```

After this, you should be ready to use the ros_web_gui.

# Running
When ros_web_gui was installed via pip, you can simply type `ros_web_gui` in the terminal.
When you checked out the repository you can run `scripts/run_flask.sh`. Then, go to your browser and open http://localhost:5000.

For trying out ros_web_gui, you can also run the `scripts/run_ros.sh` script which will
start a roscore together with a simple publisher and a subscriber for testing purposes.
