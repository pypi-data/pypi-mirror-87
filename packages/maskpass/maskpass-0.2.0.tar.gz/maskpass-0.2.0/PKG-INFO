Description: # Maskpass
        
        Maskpass is a Python library like getpass but with advanced features like masking and revealing
        
        ### Installation
        
        Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install maskpass.
        
        ```bash
        pip install maskpass
        ```
        
        ### Usage
        This module contains functions askpass() and special_askpass(), both having two optional arguments prompt and mask. The default value for prompt is `Enter Password: ` and for mask is `*`
        For most cases, `askpass()` will do, but it doesn't work for Spyder IDLE. `special_askpass()` works for Spyder but it requires [pynput](https://pypi.org/project/pynput/) to be installed. 
        
        ```python
        import maskpass
        password=maskpass.askpass()
        
        ```
        
        
        Use ` mask=""` for not echoing anything into the terminal. (Like entering sudo passwords in *nix)
        
        The function returns the entered password in string format
        
        ### For Spyder/QtConsole
        
        ```python
        import maskpass
        password=maskpass.special_askpass()
        ```
        
        `special_askpass()` also has a revealing feature which will toggle the visibility of the entered password when `Left CTRL` is pressed. Press it again to change back the visibility.
        Note: Only works with `special_askpass()` and in Spyder and needs [pynput](https://pypi.org/project/pynput/)

        Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.
        
        ### Issues
        Currently I have only tested it in Windows 10, Manjaro and Parrot, so I'm not sure it works in macOS.
        The `special_askpass()` works in Spyder. It works in Jupyter Notebook but its not that nice, better to use getpass in Jupyter.
        Haven't tested it in PyCharm yet, so it might work.
