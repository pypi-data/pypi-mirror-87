    Repaired the "synchronous_reader" modifier of enginefacade so that it
    refers to the "writer" engine when set to True, thereby allowing
    "synchronous" behavior with the writer.  When set to False, this is
    "asynchronous", so this should be associated with the async engines.
    The flag had the reverse behavior previously.
