def dt(U, epsilon=1e-4):
    """Evaluates the time discretization step of the current iteration.

    The stability condition of the numerical simulation (Known as
    Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy or CFL condition) describes that the solution
    velocity (dx/dt) has to be greater than the wave velocity. Namely, the
    simulation has to run faster than the information, in order to evaluate
    it. The wave velocity used is the greatest velocity of the waves that
    contribute to the fluid, which is the greatest eagenvalue of the Jacobian
    matrix df(U)/dU, along the x axis, and dG(U)/dU, along the y axis,
    |u| + c and |v| + c respectively.

    We equate

                      dx/dt = wave_vel => dt = dx / wave_vel

    and the magnitude that the solution velocity is greater than the wave
    velocity is handled by the Courant number (<= 1). Namely,

                             dt_final = dt * Courant.

    The velocity varies at each point of the grid, constituting the velocity
    field. So, dt is evaluated at every cell, as the mean of the dt's at x
    and y directions. Finally, the minimum dt of all cells is returned, as
    the time-step of the current iteration, ensuring that the CFL condition
    is met at all cells.

    The velocity field is step-wisely changing and, thus, the calculation
    of dt is repeated at each iteration, preserving consistency with the
    CFL condition.

    If the CFL condition is not met even at one cell, the simulation will not
    evaluate correctly the state variables there, resulting to discontinuities
    with the neighbor cells. These inconsistencies add up and bleed to nearby
    cells and, eventually the simulation (literally) blows up.

    Args:
        U (3D array)   :  the state variables, populating a x,y grid
        epsilon (float):  small number added to the denominator, to avoid
                          dividing by zero (default: 1e-6)
