Overview
--------
**Melusine** is a high-level Python library for emails classification and feature extraction,
written in Python and capable of running on top of Scikit-Learn, Keras or Tensorflow.
It was developed with a focus on emails written in french.

Use **Melusine** if you need a library which :
  * Supports both convolutional networks and recurrent networks, as well as combinations of the two.
  * Runs seamlessly on CPU and GPU.

**Melusine** is compatible with ``Python >= 3.5``.

..
  Guiding principles
  ------------------
  * **Modularity :** A model is understood as a sequence of standalone, fully configurable modules that can be plugged together with as few restrictions as possible. In particular, classification models, cleaning functions and summarization models are all standalone modules that you can combine to create new models.

  * **Easy extensibility :** New modules are simple to add (as new classes and functions), and existing modules provide ample examples. To be able to easily create new modules allows for total expressiveness, making Melusine suitable for specific goals.

  * **Work with Python :** No separate models configuration files in a declarative format. Models are described in Python code, which is compact, easier to debug, and allows for ease of extensibility.

  :scale: 30%

This package is designed for the preprocessing, classification and automatic summarization of emails written in french.
**3 main subpackages are offered :**

* :ref:`prepare_email <prepare_email>` : to preprocess and clean the emails.
* :ref:`summarizer <summarizer>` : to extract keywords from an email.
* :ref:`models <models>` : to classify e-mails according to categories pre-defined defined by the user.

**2 other subpackages are offered as building blocks :**

* :ref:`nlp_tools <nlp_tools>` : to provide classic NLP tools such as tokenizer, phraser and embeddings.
* :ref:`utils <utils>` : to provide a *TransformerScheduler* class to build your own transformer and integrate it into a scikit-learn Pipeline.

**An other subpackage is also provided** to manage, modify or add parameters such as : regular expressions, keywords, stopwords, etc.

* :ref:`config <config>` : contains *ConfigJsonReader* class to setup and handle a *conf.json* file. This JSON file is the core of this package since it's used by different submodules to preprocess the data.

    - *date*   : Reception date of an email
    - *from*   : Email address of the sender
    - *to*  (optional): Email address of the recipient
    - *label* (optional): Label of the email for a classification task (examples: Business, Spam, Finance or Family)

.. csv-table::
    :header: body, header, date, from, to, label

    "Thank you.\\nBye,\\nJohn", "Re: Your order", "jeudi 24 mai 2018 11 h 49 CEST", "anonymous.sender@unknown.com", "anonymous.recipient@unknown.fr", "??"

    nn_model.fit(X, y)
    y_res = nn_model.predict(X)


Glossary
--------
Pandas dataframes columns
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Because Melusine manipulates pandas dataframes, the naming of the columns is imposed.
Here is a basic glossary to provide an understanding of each columns manipulated.
Initial columns of the dataframe:

* **body :** the body of the email. It can be composed of a unique message, a history of messages, a transfer of messages or a combination of history and transfers.
* **header :** the subject of the email.
* **date :** the date the email has been sent. It corresponds to the date of the last message of the email has been written.
* **from :** the email address of the author of the last message of the email.
* **to :** the email address of the recipient of the last message.

Columns added by Melusine:

* **is_begin_by_transfer :** boolean, indicates if the email is a direct transfer. In that case it is recommended to update the value of the initial columns with the informations of the message transferred.
* **is_answer :** boolean, indicates if the email contains a history of messages
* **is_transfer :** boolean, indicates if the email is a transfer (in that case it does not have to be a direct transfer).
* **structured_historic :** list of dictionaries, each dictionary corresponds to a message of the email. The first dictionary corresponds to the last message (the one that has been written) while the last dictionary corresponds to the first message of the history. Each dictionary has two keys :

  - *meta :* to access the metadata of the message as a string.
  - *text :* to access the message itself as a string.

* **structured_body :** list of dictionaries, each dictionary corresponds to a message of the email. The first dictionary corresponds to the last message (the one that has been written) while the last dictionary corresponds to the first message of the history. Each dictionary has two keys :

  - *meta :* to access the metadata of the message as a dictionary. The dictionary has three keys:

    + *date :* the date of the message.
    + *from :* the email address of the author of the message.
    + *to :* the email address of the recipient of the message.

  - *text :* to access the message itself as a dictionary. The dictionary has two keys:

    + *header :* the subject of the message.
    + *structured_text :* the different parts of the message segmented and tagged as a list of dictionaries. Each dictionary has two keys:

      - *part :* to access the part of the message as a string.
      - *tags :* to access the tag of the part of the message.

* **last_body :** string, corresponds to the part of the last message of the email that has been tagged as "BODY".
* **clean_body :** string, corresponds a cleaned last_body.
* **clean_header :** string, corresponds to a cleaned header.
* **clean_text :** string, concatenation of clean_header and clean_body.
* **tokens :** list of strings, corresponds to a tokenized column, by default clean_text.
* **keywords :** list of strings, corresponds to the keywords of extracted from the tokens column.

Tags
^^^^
Each messages of an email are segmented the in the **structured_body** columns and each parts are assigned a tag:

* "RE/TR" : any metadata such as date, from, to etc.
* "DISCLAIMER" : any disclaimer such as "L'émetteur décline toute responsabilité...".
* "GREETINGS" : any greetings such as "Salutations".
* "PJ" : any indication of an attached document such as "See attached file...".
* "FOOTER" : any footer such as "Provenance : Courrier pour Windows".
* "HELLO" : any salutations such as "Bonjour,".
* "THANKS" : any thanks such as "Avec mes remerciements"
* "BODY" : the core of the the message which contains the valuable information.


Motivation & history
--------------------

Origin of the project
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
**MAIF**, being one of the leading mutual insurance companies in France, receives daily a large volume of emails from its clients
and is under pressure to reply to their requests as efficiently as possible. As such an efficient routing system is of the
upmost importance to assign each emails to its right entity.
However the previously outdated routing system put the company under ever increasing difficulties to fulfill its pledge.
In order to face up to this challenge, MAIF has implemented a new routing system
based on state-of-the-art NLP and Deep Learning techniques that would classify each email under the right label
according to its content and extract the relevant information to help the MAIF counsellors processing the emails.

Ambitions of the project
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
**Melusine** is the first Open Source and free-of-use solution dedicated specifically to the qualification of e-mails written in french.
The ambition of this Python package is to become a reference, but also to live in the French NLP community by federating users and contributors.
Initially developed to answer the problem of routing e-mails received by the MAIF, the solution was implemented using state-of-the-art techniques in Deep Learning and NLP.
Melusine can be interfaced with Scikit-Learn: it offers the user the possibility to train his own classification and automatic summarization model according to the constraints of his problem.


Why Melusine ?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Following MAIF's tradition to name its open source packages after deities, it was chosen to release this package
under the name of Melusine as an homage to a legend from the local folklore in the Poitou region in France
where MAIF is historically based.
