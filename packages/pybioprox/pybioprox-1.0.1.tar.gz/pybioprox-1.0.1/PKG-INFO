Description: # PyBioProx: 2 & 3d spatial distance analysis in Python
        
        This module, `pybioprox`, offers efficient 2d and 3d spatial analysis of colocalisation. 
        The analyses fall into the category of object-based colocalisation methods. 
        
        ## Installation 
        
        To install this Python module, you may use pip as follows: 
        
        ```
            pip install PyBioProx
        ```
        
        If you wish to also install the optional Graphical User Interface script, this may be done 
        by specifying the `gui` optional extra: 
        
        ```
            pip install PyBioProx[gui]
        ```
        
        
        ## Getting started
        
        Once installed, the module can be invoked from the command-line using: 
        
        ```
            python -m pybioprox <path_to_folder> 
        ```
        
        to run the analysis in batch mode on all data files at the location `path_to_folder`. 
        
        If you have installed the gui component, then you may also run 
        ```
            pybioprox_gui.py
        ```
        directly from the command line.
