Description: # Reverse-engineer DBC definitions from CAN dumps. #
        
        This library offers APIs to automatically reverse-engineer strctural definitions of CAN packets by analyzing CAN dumps. It comes with a command line tool to conveniently analyze data from camdump files as created by the [can-utils](https://github.com/linux-can/can-utils). The software focuses on reverse-engineering structures that can be described using DBC.
        
        ## Installation ##
        
        Install the latest release using pip (``pip install revdbc``) or manually from source by running ``pip install .`` (preferred) or ``python setup.py install`` in the cloned repository. Doing so installs both the library for programmatic usage and an executable called `revdbc`. Use `revdbc --help` for usage information.
