Android Stacking Game Kivy
**************************

This is a tutorial on how to build a basic tower stacking game for Android using
Pymunk together with Kivy and Python-for-Android. The tower will be built by 
stacking rectangular blocks on top of each other, with semi-realistic physics to
make it interesting.

In the end we will have a game that can run on Android and on the common 
desktop systems (Windows, Linux and OSX). The Android specific parts of this 
tutorial can be easily skipped in case you have no interest in Android/mobile 
development. 

In order to test your game you will need a Android phone that can install apps
on the side, since we wont release the game on Google App Store. 



Requirements
============

I will assume that you have at least a basic coding experience in Python. It is 
also good if you can open a command prompt and run some commands there.
However, no special knowledge of Pymunk, Kivy or Android development is required
to follow this tutorial. 

The end result will be a Android game, 


The plan
========

The goal is to build a simple tower stacking / building game. Blocks 
(rectangles) come from the top of the screen and the player need to place them 
on top of each other to build as high tower as possible. The game is controlled 
with the mouse or finger in case of a touch screen.

We can break down the game into several small steps. 

I will write down the requirements in a 

In terms of features we need: 
1. A floor in the bottom of the screen on which the blocks can land.
2. Creation of blocks of random size, contr
3. A way to measure when/if the tower is stable.
4. Keeping track of the total height of the (stable) tower.
5. Detect if the tower falls over.
6. A high score

In addition:
1. Pack the game into an APK that can run on Android.
