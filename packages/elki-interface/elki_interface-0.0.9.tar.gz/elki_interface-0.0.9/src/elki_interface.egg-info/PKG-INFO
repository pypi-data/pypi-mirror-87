Description: # elki_interface
        An example of how one could realize a python interface for the ELKI datamining tool.
        
        This is not a wrapper, just a CLI with a few python-esque bells and whistles.
        
        At most, it is an example of how one could go about building a clean python interface from python to the ELKI CLI. Currently this project only exposes the HiCS method for outlier detection.
