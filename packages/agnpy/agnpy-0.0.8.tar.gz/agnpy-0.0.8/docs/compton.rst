Inverse Compton
===============

Two different Compton processes are considered:

* Synchrotron Self Compton (SSC), implemented in the class :class:`~agnpy.compton.SynchrotronSelfCompton`, foreseeing as target for the inverse Compton the synchrotron photons produced in the blob by the accelerated electrons (based on [DermerMenon2009]_ and [Finke2008]_); 
 
* External Compton (EC), implemented in the class :class:`~agnpy.compton.ExternalCompton`, foreseeing as a target for the inverse Compton the (direct and reprocessed) photon fields generated by the accretion phenomena (based on [Dermer2009]_ and [Finke2016]_). 


Synchrotron Self-Compton
------------------------
The Synchrotron Self-Compton radiation calculation works exactly as the :ref:`synchrotron` one.
The instance of the emission region has to be feeded to the radiative class initialiser.
SED can be evaluated over an array of frequencies with the ``sed_flux`` method.

External Compton
----------------
As an example of this process, let us consider Compton scattering of the photon field produced by the disk by a 
power-law electron distribution.

.. plot:: snippets/ec_snippet.py
	:include-source:

As we can see, the EC radiation can be computed passing to the :class:`~agnpy.compton.ExternalCompton` 
class the instance of the emission region (:class:`~agnpy.emission_regions.Blob`) **and** the instance of the 
target (:class:`~agnpy.targets.SSDisk`). **Note** also to the distance between the blob and the target photon field (``r``)
has to be specified

.. code-block:: python
	
	ec = ExternalCompton(blob, disk, r)
   
You can use any object in the :py:mod:`~agnpy.targets` module as target for external Compton.
