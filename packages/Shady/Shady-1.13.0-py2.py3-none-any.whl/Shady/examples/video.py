#: Decoding and rendering of frames from a movie file or camera
"""
This demo script shows some of the things that can be done with
video stimuli.

By explicitly importing `Shady.Video`, you can enable the `.video`
property of the `Stimulus` class.   You can assign the filename of
a video file, or the integer ID of a live camera, to this property
(it is actually redirected to `.video.source`,  with `.video`
itself being an object that is implicitly constructed when needed).

Video file decoding and live camera acquisition both require the
`cv2` module from the third-party package`opencv-python`, which
can be installed via `pip`.

Be warned that video stimuli are fundamentally less efficient
than Shady's other more typical stimulus approaches: rather than
transferring everything to the graphics card up-front, or allowing
everything to be generated on-the-fly on the GPU, this uses
CPU code to decode every new frame from the video source and then
to transfer it from CPU to GPU.  Timing performance will likely
suffer as a result.

		According to the command-line arguments, we've been asked

		"""
		In the first step, the video is not transformed.  Shady
		only transfers new data from CPU to GPU when a new image
		is supplied by the camera or decoded from the file. Note
		however, that even this will affect frame timing: Shady
		operates most smoothly when all possible image frames
		have been pre-loaded onto the GPU.

		The next 3-second state demonstrates an efficient video-frame
		transformation: every time a *new* frame is decoded, transform
		it (in this case, desaturate it).  Not every display frame

		video hasn't changed, return `None` to signal that nothing
