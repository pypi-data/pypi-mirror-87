        This package is for Mission Pinball Framework (MPF) Monitor
        (mpf-monitor).
        
        The MPF monitor is a graphical app that connects to a live running
        instance of MPF and shows the status of various devices. (LEDs,
        switches, ball locks, etc.). You can add a picture of your playfield and
        drag-and-drop devices to their proper locations so you can interact with
        your machine when you're not near your physical machine.
        
        The MPF Monitor can run on Windows, Mac, and Linux. It uses PyQt5
        (Python bindings for Qt5) for its visual framework.
        
        Installation & Instructions
        ---------------------------
        
        Full instructions for installing and using the MPF monitor are included

        http://docs.missionpinball.org/en/latest/tools/monitor
        
        **Note:** MPF Monitor requires PyQt5. There is a Python package for
        Python 3.5 which will be installed automatically if you're using Python
        3.5. If you're using Python 3.4, you will need to download and install
        PyQt5 manually. See the installation instructions in the link above for
