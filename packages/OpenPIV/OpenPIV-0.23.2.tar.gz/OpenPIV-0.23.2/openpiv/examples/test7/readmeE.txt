Instructions for the analysis of case E: 
Shear Field
28.10.2000 		okamoto@tokai.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp

Flow Field

 * The flow field was shear field generated by computer.
 * The field parameter is not known.
 * The non-uniform illumination condition was simulated.


Image generation
 * The particle scatter was assumed to be the gaussian distribution.
 * The occlusion particle was considered.
    The intensity of the particles were linearly added.
 * Fill factor was assumed to be 0.7.
 * Particle diameters were randomly determined.
    The histogram of the particle diameter was gaussian distribution.
 * Laser light sheet intensity was assumed to be gaussian.
    Maximum out-of-plane velocity was set to be about 20% of
    laser light thickness.
 * Illumination intensity was varied.
 * The image  size is 256 x 128 pixel. They are provided in tif format with a 
    header of 285 bytes.
