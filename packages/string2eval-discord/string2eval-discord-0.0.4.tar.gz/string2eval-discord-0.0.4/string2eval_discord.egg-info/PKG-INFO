Description: hi arno
        
        import `string2eval` to do the kurdish and use `string2eval.evaluate(ctx, client, body)` to do th
        
        ctx is ctx, client is your client, and body is the code you want to evaluate
        
        while defining client put your id in `owner_ids` to make it ONLY work when you use the eval. you can put
        more than one person
        
        **DO NOT** put `@commands.is_owner()` or  try to make the command owner only yourself.
        it handles that automatically.
        
        if someone who doesn't have access tries to use it it will raise `NoPermsToEval`
        
        **ENABLE PRESENCE AND MEMBERS INTENT (NOT REQUIRED BUT WORKS BEST)**
        
        funny example
        
        ```python
        from discord.ext import commands
        import string2eval
        
        TOKEN = "??"
        
        client = commands.Bot(command_prefix="!!!", owner_ids=[429935667737264139])
        
        client.remove_command("help")
        
        @client.command(name="eval")
        async def _eval(ctx, *, body):
            try:
                await string2eval.evaluate(ctx, client, body)
            except string2eval.NoPermsToEval:
                await ctx.send("lol cant even use eval smh")
        
        client.run(TOKEN)
        ```
