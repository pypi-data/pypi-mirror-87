- Explicitly sort the time dimension of the ``ssebopeta_bygeom`` function.

Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

0.7.1 (2020-8-13)
-----------------

New Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

  plot title, called ``title_ypos``. This could be useful for multi-line titles.

~~~~~~~~~
- Fixed an issue with the ``nlcd`` function where none layers are not dropped and cause the
  function to fails.

0.7.0 (2020-8-12)
-----------------

This version divides Hydrodata into six standalone Python libraries. So many of the changes
listed below belong to the modules and functions that are now a separate package. This decision
was made for reducing the complexity of the code base and allow the users to only install
the packages that they need without having to install all the Hydrodata dependencies.

Breaking changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- The ``services`` module is now a separate package called PyGeoOGCC and is set as a requirement
  for Hydrodata. PyGeoOGC is a leaner package with much less dependencies and is suitable for
  people who might only need an interface to web services.
- Unified function names for getting feature by ID and by box.
- Combined ``start`` and ``end`` arguments into a ``tuple`` argument
  called ``dates`` across the code base.
- Rewrote NLDI function and moved most of its classmethods to Station
  so now Station class has more cohesion.
- Removed exploratory functionality of ``ArcGISREST``, since it's more convenient
  to do so from a browser. Now, ``base_url`` is a required arguments.
- Renamed ``in_crs`` in ``datasets`` and ``services`` functions to ``geo_crs`` for geometry and
  ``box_crs`` for bounding box inputs.
- Re-wrote the ``signatures`` function from scratch using ``NamedTuple`` to improve readability
  and efficiency. Now, the ``daily`` argument should be just a ``pandas.DataFrame`` or
  ``pandas.Series`` and the column names are used for legends.
- Removed ``utils.geom_mask`` function and replaced it with ``rasterio.mask.mask``.
- Removed ``width`` as an input in functions with raster output since ``resolution`` is almost
  always the preferred way to request for data. This change made the code more readable.
- Renamed two functions: ``ArcGISRESTful`` and ``wms_bybox``. These function now return
  ``requests.Response`` type output.
- ``onlyipv4`` is now a class method in ``RetrySession``.
- The ``plot.signatures`` function now assumes that the input time series are in mm/day.
- Added a flag to ``get_streamflow`` function in the ``NWIS`` class to convert from cms
  to mm/day which is useful for plotting hydrologic signatures using the ``signatures``
  functions.

Enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Remove soft requirements from the env files.
- Refactored ``requests`` functions into a single class and a separate file.
- Made all the classes available directly from ``hydrodata``.
- Added `CodeFactor <https://www.codefactor.io/>`_ to the Github pipeline and addressed
  the some of issues
  that CodeFactor found.
- Added `Bandit <https://bandit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ to check the code for
  secutiry issue.
- Improved docstrings and documentations.
- Added customized exceptions for better exception handling.
- Added ``pytest`` fixtures to improve the tests speed.
- Refactored ``daymet`` and ``nwis_siteinfo`` functions to reduce code complexity
  and improve readability.
- Major refactoring of the code base while adding type hinting.
- The input geometry (or bounding box) can be provided in any projection
  and the necessary re-projections are done under the hood.
- Refactored the method for getting object IDs in ``ArcGISREST`` class to improve
  robustness and efficiency.
- Refactored ``Daymet`` class to improve readability.
- Add `Deepsource <https://deepsource.io/>`_ for further code quality checking.
- Automatic handling of large WMS requests (more than 8 million pixel i.e., width x height)
- The ``json_togeodf`` function now accepts both a single (Geo)JSON or a list of them
- Refactored ``plot.signatures`` using ``add_gridspec`` for a much cleaner code.

New Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Added access to WaterData's Geoserver databases.
- Added access to the remaining NLDI database (Water Quality Portal and Water Data Exchange).
- Created a Binder for launching a computing environment on the cloud and testing Hydrodata.
- Added a URL repository for the supported services called ``ServiceURL``
- Added support for `FEMA <https://hazards.fema.gov/femaportal/wps/portal/NFHLWMS>`_ web services
  for flood maps and `FWS <https://www.fws.gov/wetlands/Data/Web-Map-Services.html>`_ for wetlands.
- Added a new function called ``wms_toxarray`` for converting WMS request responses to
  ``xarray.DataArray`` or ``xarray.Dataset``.

Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~
- Re-projection issues for function with input geometry.
- Start and end variables not being initialized when coords was used in ``Station``.
- Geometry mask for ``xarray.DataArray``
- WMS output re-projections
