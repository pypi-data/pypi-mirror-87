    __PARAMETERS__ 
    RIBBIT requires the user to select a set of parameters that describe the target vocalization. Here is some detailed advice on how to use these parameters.

    **Signal Band:** The signal band is the frequency range where RIBBIT looks for the target species. It is best to pick a narrow signal band if possible, so that the model focuses on a specific part of the spectrogram and has less potential to include erronious sounds. 

    **Noise Bands:** Optionally, users can specify other frequency ranges called noise bands. Sounds in the `noise_bands` are _subtracted_ from the `signal_band`. Noise bands help the model filter out erronious sounds from the recordings, which could include confusion species, background noise, and popping/clicking of the microphone due to rain, wind, or digital errors. It's usually good to include one noise band for very low frequencies -- this specifically eliminates popping and clicking from being registered as a vocalization. It's also good to specify noise bands that target confusion species. Another approach is to specify two narrow `noise_bands` that are directly above and below the `signal_band`. 

    **Pulse Rate Range:** This parameters specifies the minimum and maximum pulse rate (the number of pulses per second, also known as pulse repetition rate) RIBBIT should look for to find the focal species. For example, choosing `pulse_rate_range = [10, 20]` means that RIBBIT should look for pulses no slower than 10 pulses per second and no faster than 20 pulses per second. 

    **Window Length:** This parameter tells RIBBIT how many seconds of audio to analyze at one time. Generally, you should choose a `window_length` that is similar to the length of the target species vocalization, or a little bit longer. For very slowly pulsing vocalizations, choose a longer window so that at least 5 pulses can occur in one window (0.5 pulses per second -> 10 second window). Typical values for `window_length` are 1 to 10 seconds. 

    **Plot:** We can choose to show the power spectrum of pulse repetition rate for each window by setting `plot=True`. The default is not to show these plots (`plot=False`).
    
    __ALGORITHM__
    This is the procedure RIBBIT follows:
    divide the audio into segments of length window_len
    for each clip:
        calculate time series of energy in signal band (signal_band) and subtract noise band energies (noise_bands)
        calculate power spectral density of the amplitude time series
        score the file based on the maximum value of power-spectral-density in the pulse rate range
