## Evidence Collection Process

### PVS1
* PVS1 null variant (nonsense, frameshift, canonical ±1 or 2 splice sites, initiation codon, single or multiexon deletion) in a gene where LOF is a known mechanism of disease.

#### Status
* Implemented

#### Resources
* LoF genes list from intervar. https://raw.githubusercontent.com/barslmn/InterVar/master/intervardb/PVS1.LOF.genes.hg19
* Null variants defined as HIGH IMPACT by https://www.ensembl.org/info/genome/variation/prediction/predicted_data.html

#### Conditions
* "gene_symbol" is in LoF gene list.
* "transcript_consequence_terms" is high impact.

#### Shortcomings
* LoF gene list is only predictive and may be missing some actual LoF genes.
* No checks for multiexon deletion.

### PS1
* Same amino acid change as a previously established pathogenic variant regardless of nucleotide change.

#### Status
* Implemented

#### Resources
* Clinvar xml (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/clinvar/)

#### Annotation Steps
1. Clinvar data is parsed using https://github.com/barslmn/clinvar.
2. Sample data and clinvar data is merged based on columns "CHR" and "POS".
3. Clinvar feature columns "ALT", "hgvsp", and "clinical_significance" added to original annotation.

#### Conditions
1. "clinical_significance" is pathogenic.
2. Sample "hgvsp" and later added clinvar "hgvsp" changes are the same.
3. Sample "ALT" and clinvar "ALT" are different.

#### Status
* Broken. (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻)

#### Resources
* Clinvar xml (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/clinvar/)

#### Annotation Steps
1. Clinvar data is parsed using https://github.com/barslmn/clinvar.
2. Sample data and clinvar data hgvsp columns parsed till position.
3. Synonym changes removed from clinvar data.
4. Clinvar feature columns "hgvsc", and "clinical_significance" added to original annotation based on protein change position.

#### Conditions
1. "gnomad" less then 0.001.
2. "clinical_significance" is pathogenic.
3. "transcript_consequence_terms" is missense variant.
