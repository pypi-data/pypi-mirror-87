upgrade:
  - The allowed values for the ``connection_debug`` option are now restricted to
    the range between 0 and 100 (inclusive). Previously a number lower than 0
    or higher than 100 could be given without error. But now, a
    ``ConfigFileValueError`` will be raised when the option value is outside this
    range.
