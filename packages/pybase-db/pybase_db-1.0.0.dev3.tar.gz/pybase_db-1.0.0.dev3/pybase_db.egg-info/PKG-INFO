        PyBase is a DataBase Manager for multiple filetypes including SQLite3.
        
        It's focused on the ease and effectiveness for the administration of databases.
        
        ------
        
        ## Why PyBase?
        **If you want to store static data** (JSON, YAML, TOML, Bytes) **or store a database in SQLite3**,
        **the best thing would be to use an administrator that simplifies your tasks and
        helps you with a good organization and efficiently.**
        
        **PyBase does exactly that, allows you to create such databases with
        just one method, and simplifies the task of manipulating their data!**

        ------
        
        # Quick start
        ## Installation
        PyBase requires Python 3.x and can be installed through `pip` with the following command.
        ```sh
        # Stable version
        python3 -m pip install -U pybase_db
        
        # Pre-release (Development) version
        python3 -m pip install -U --pre pybase_db
        
        # From github's latest commit
        # Available branches:
        #   • master (recommended)
        #   • development (unstable releases)
        # NOTE: this installation mode will not install PyBase dependencies!
        python3 -m pip install -U git+https://github.com/PyBase/PyBase@branch
        ```
        
        ### Building
        The development branch changes aren't compiled and uploaded to Pypi every time,
        so you must compile a wheel yourself to test the experimental stuff if the newest
        changes aren't uploaded to Pypi.
        ```sh
        python3 setup.py bdist_wheel
        
        python3 -m pip install -U dist/pybase_db-version-py3-none-any.whl
        ```
        
        ## Usage example
        This is a brief example of the methods that PyBase currently has.
        ```py
        # Lets import PyBase Class from PyBase Package
        from pybase_db import PyBase
        
        # Lets define our database name and format (with default db_path).
        # db_type isn't case sensitive. You can use JSON and json and it'll be valid.
        db = PyBase(database="example", db_type="JSON")  # => ./example.json
        
        # Lets define and add some content to our database.
        pybase_info = {"pybase": "awesomeness", "version": "1.0.0"}
        
        # Lets insert the defined dict inside our database.
        db.insert(pybase_info,
                  mode="w")  # => {'pybase': 'awesomeness', 'version': '1.0.0'}
        
        # Lets delete an object inside our database cuz it's useless.
        db.delete('pybase')  # => {'version': '1.0.0'}
        
        # Lets insert more data cuz that's funny!
        db.insert(content={"guilds": {}, "ownerID": 1234567890}, mode="w")
        
        # Lets insert some data inside the guilds key
        db.insert(content={
            "guilds": {
                "12345": {
                    "name": "First guild"
                },
                "67890": {
                    "name": "Second guild"
                }
            }
        },
                  mode="a")
        
        # Lets fetch an object inside our database and display its type.
        # It's useful to debug and manipulate the data dynamically.
        db.fetch('version')  # => <class 'str'>
        
        # Gets the corresponding value according to the specified key
        db.get("version")  # => '1.0.0'
        
        # New data of the new update
        pybase_update = {"pybase": {"newVersion": {"version": "1.0.0"}}}
        db.insert(pybase_update)
        
        # Get all data from db
        db.get()  # => {'pybase': {'newVersion': {'version': '1.0.0'}}, 'version': '1.0.0'}
        
        # Get the values using its key
        db.get("pybase")  # => {'newVersion': {'version': '1.0.0'}}
        
        # Get a value of a key separated by a period (.)
        db.get("pybase.newVersion")  # => {'version': '1.0.0'}
        
        # Several
        db.get("pybase.newVersion.version")  # => 1.0.0
        ```
