A Python library for operating QMotion blinds controlled a QSync device on the local network. The program is written in Python 3. Network protocol dissection can be found in the comments within the qsync_control.py file. Protocol details are inferred from Wireshark monitoring of the network traffic between the QMotion QSync iPhone app and the QSync device.

Usage examples can be found at: https://github.com/exitexit/qsync-control
