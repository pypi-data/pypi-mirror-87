        - `x` - The particle position (or 1-dimensional NDArray of
          particle positions) at which noise should be calculated

        particular time, position(s), and task conditions.

        automatically select the best simulation methods for the

        is a scalar, or an NDArray of the same size as `x` if `x` is
        an NDArray.  If the function does not depend on `x`, it should

        increase by using numpy vectorization.)
