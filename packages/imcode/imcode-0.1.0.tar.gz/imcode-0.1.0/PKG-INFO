        required arguments:
          --port PORT          the port you want to run code-server on
        
        optional arguments:
          --password PASSWORD  password to protect your code-server from unauthorized access
          --mount_drive        if you use --mount_drive, your google drive will be mounted
        ```
        
        Else, you can do the following:
        
        
        ```shell
        # import imcode
        $ from imcode import ImCode
        
        # run imcode with by deafult options.
        $ ImCode()
        
        # ImCode has the following arguments:
        # - port: the port you want to run code-server on, default 10000
        # - password: password to protect your code server from being accessed by someone else. Note that there is no password by default!
        # - mount_drive: True or False to mount your Google Drive
        
        $ ImCode(port=10000, password="nitin", mount_drive=True)
        ```
