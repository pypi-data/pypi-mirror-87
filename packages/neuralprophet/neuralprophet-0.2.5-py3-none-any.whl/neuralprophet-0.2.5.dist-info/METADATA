# NeuralProphet
A Neural Network based Time-Series model, inspired by [Facebook Prophet](https://github.com/facebook/prophet) and [AR-Net](https://github.com/ourownstory/AR-Net), built on PyTorch.

For a visual introduction to NeuralProphet, view the presentation given at the [40th International Symposium on Forecasting](notes/Presented_at_International_Symposium_on_Forecasting.pdf).

## Documentation
We are working on a [documentation page](https://ourownstory.github.io/neural_prophet/). Contributions welcome!

## Use 
### Install
After cloning the code repository  you can install neuralprophet as regular python package:
```shell
git clone <copied link from github>
pip install neural_prophet
```

If you plan to use the package in a Jupyter notebook, we recommended to install the 'live' version:
```shell
pip install neural_prophet[live]
```
This will allow you to enable `plot_live_loss` in the `fit` function to get a live plot of train (and validation) loss.

### Basic example
```python
from neuralprophet import NeuralProphet
```
After importing the package, you can use NeuralProphet in your code:
```python
m = NeuralProphet()
metrics = m.fit(df, freq="D")
future = m.make_future_dataframe(df, periods=30)
forecast = m.predict(future)
```
You can visualize your results with the inbuilt plotting functions:
```python
fig_forecast = m.plot(forecast)
fig_components = m.plot_components(forecast)
fig_model = m.plot_parameters()
```


## Model Features
* Autocorrelation modelling through AR-Net
* Piecewise linear trend
* Fourier term Seasonality at different periods such as yearly, daily, weekly, hourly.
* Lagged regressors
* Future regressors
* Holidays & special events
* Sparsity of coefficients through regularization
* Plotting for forecast components, model coefficients as well as final forecasts

## Contribute
### Dev Install
After downloading the code repository (via `git clone`), change to the repository directory (`cd neural_prophet`), activate your virtual environment, and install neuralprophet as python package with
`pip install -e .[dev]`

(Including the optional `-e` flag will install neuralprophet in "editable" mode, meaning that instead of copying the files into your virtual environment, a symlink will be created to the files where they are.)

Additionally you must run `$ neuralprophet_dev_setup` in your console to run the dev-setup script which installs appropriate git hooks for Black and Unittests.

### Style
We deploy Black, the uncompromising code formatter, so there is no need to worry about style. Beyond that, where reasonable, for example for docstrings, we follow the [Google Python Style Guide](http://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html)

As for Git practices, please follow the steps described at [Swiss Cheese](https://github.com/ourownstory/swiss-cheese/blob/master/git_best_practices.md) for how to git-rebase-squash when working on a forked repo.

## Changelogs
### Coming up Next
For details, please view the [Development Timeline](notes/development_timeline.md).

The next versions of NeuralProphet are expected to cover a set of new exciting features:

* Robustify training for different datasets
* Logistic growth for trend component.
* Uncertainty estimation of individual forecast components as well as the final forecasts. 
* Support for panel data by building global forecasting models.
* Incorporate time series featurization for improved forecast accuracy.

### 0.2.6 (next release)
* soft-start regularization
* confidence interval for forecast (as quantiles via pinball loss)

### 0.2.5 (current release)
* documentation pages added
* 1cycle policy
* learning rate range test
* tutorial notebooks: trend, events
* fixes to plotting, changepoints
