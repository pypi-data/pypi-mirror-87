                This is a Python library for analysis for the Galvanostatic Charge Discharge <b>(GCD)</b> curves as well as the Cyclic Voltammetry <b>(CV)</b> curves of two-electrode, symmetrical supercapacitors. It provides an easy and standardised way to quickly extract useful information from the GCD and CV data, including the <b>capacitance</b> and the <b>ESR </b>of the supercapacitor and how they evolve over cycles, with multiple options offered to suit the need of scientific investigations of supercapacitors. 
        
        <br>
        <br>
        
        For <b>GCD</b> analysis, the capacitance is calculated via linear fitting the second half of the discharging slope in each charging/discharging cycle. For <b>gravimetric capacitance (<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=F%20g^{-1}">)</b>:

        </p>
        
        <br>

        ## <a href="#sub_TOC"><b>Load_capacitor</b><i>(pathway, t_set = False, V_set = False, delimiter = False, mass_ls = False, current = False, row_skip = False, ESR_method = True, setting = False, cap_method = False, cap_grav = True)</i></a> 
        This function loads the txt/csv file specified on the pathway into the <b>Supercap</b> class ,where capacitance and ESR analysis will be carried out. All relevant information can be extracted from the init function.
        
        
        ### Notes
        ---
        This function supports electrochemical data in either txt or csv format. In a txt file, it is by default that the first coloumn of the file is assumed to be time (s), and the second coloumn is assumed to be Voltage (V) for the GCD analysis. The two coloumns are assumed to be seperated by space. However, the optional arguments, <i>t_set, V_set, delimeter and row_skip</i>, offers flexibility in dealing with more complex data files. 
        
        
        
        ### Parameters

           An integer specifying the coloumn index for time(s) data, with the first coloumn being coloumn 0 starting from left. If t_set = False, column 0 will be used as time(s); if t_set = False, there will be prompt asking for time coloumn index to be entered.For csv files, the coloumn index can also be the name of the coloumn (e.g. <code>t_set = 'time(s)'</code>). 
           
           
        3. <b>V_set : <i>int/str(csv files only), optional</i></b> <br>
           An integer specifying the coloumn index for voltage(V) data, with the first coloumn being coloumn 0 starting from left. If V_set = False, column 1 will be used as Voltage(V); if t_set = False, there will be prompt asking for voltage coloumn index to be entered. For csv files, the coloumn index can also be the name of the coloumn (e.g. <code>V_set = 'voltage(V)'</code>). 
        
        
        4. <b>delimiter : <i>str, optional</i></b> <br>
            A string which is used to seperate the data coloumns in the data file. If <code>delimiter = False</code>, the delimiter is assumed to be space <code>' '</code>.
        
        
        5. <b>mass_ls : <i>list, [[measurements of m1], [measurements of m2]], optional</i></b> <br>
           A list specifying the mass of each electrode in the format as shwon above. Multiple measurements for each electrode should be included for calculation of the uncertainty of the data. All masses should be recorded in <b>mg</b>. If mass_ls = False, a non-gravimetric capacitanc will be calculated and the function returns <i><code>[[False, False], [False, False]]</code></i> for the <code>.masses</code> method in the resulting Supercap entity (more details for extracting data from the Supercap class in <a href="#__init__">Supercap class>>init</a>

For all methods available please refer to the next session <a href="#method_table">ESR_method</a> table. <code>ESR_setting = False</code> will return <code>.esr_ls</code> as <b>False</b> in the Supercap class. Available ESR_methods are: <code>ESR_methods = True, False, 1, 101, 2, 201. </code>
        
        
        9. <b>setting : <i>float, optional</i></b><br>
           For <code>ESR_methods = True, 1, or 2 </code>, <code>setting = False</code>. For <code>ESR_methods = 101 or 201 </code>, setting is required as the number of points n/second derivative cut off point needed for the constant point method and the constant derivative method, respectively. If <code>ESR_methods = 101 or 201 </code> but <code>setting = False</code>, the function will promt the user to choose a specific value for the ESR analysis before proceeding.

        ### Notes
        ---
          1. Capacitance and ESR analysis for one supercapacitor under different currents. 
          2. Error bars are calculated from the mass errors of the electrodoes as other errors are insignificant compared to that caused by mass. 
          3. The masses in mass_ls is in <b>mg</b>. 
          4. It is assumed that all data files in the folder are measured from the same capacitor, hence they all have <b>the same mass_ls</b>. 
          5. The current has to be included in the file name in the current format as specified under <a href="#path"> Parameters >> path</a>

        ## <a href="#sub_TOC"><b>CV_analysis</b><i>(pathway, m1, m2, scan_r = False, row_skip = False, x_name = False, y_name = False, delimiter = False, int_method = False)</i></a>
        Under construction...coming soon!
        This function loads the txt/csv file specified on the pathway, where capacitance analysis on the Cyclic Voltammetry will be carried out. The function returns a list of capacitance calculated from each CV cycle. 
        
        
        ### Notes
        ---
        This function supports electrochemical data in either txt or csv format. In a txt file, it is by default that the first coloumn of the file is assumed to be voltage (V), and the second coloumn is assumed to be current (mA) for the GCD analysis. The two coloumns are assumed to be seperated by space. However, the optional arguments, <i>x_name, y_name, delimeter and row_skip</i>, offers flexibility in dealing with more complex data files. 
        
        
        
        ### Parameters
        ---
        
        #### Arguments
        1. <b>pathway : <i>file, str, or pathlib.Path</i></b> <br>
            File, filename of the text file to read. Note that if the library is not allocated in the same directory as the file, the pathway to the file has to be given. For <b>``` scan_r=False```</b>, current will be directly read from the filename (i.e. the fielname has to include the current followed by <code>'_mvs'</code> and seperated by <code>'_'</code>, <code>'/'</code> or it is the first component of the filename). If scan rate information cannot be obtained from the filename, the scan rate has to be specified via the <code>current</code> argument. For more details, refer to the Examples section. This function currently only supports data in the format of txt or csv. 
        
        
        2. <b>m1 : <i>float, optional</i></b> <br>
            The mass of electrode 1 of the supercapacitor. The mass is in mg.
            
            
        3. <b>m2 : <i>float, optional</i></b> <br>
            The mass of electrode 2 of the supercapacitor. The mass is in mg.
        
        
        4. <b>scan_r : <i> float, optional</i></b><br>
           If <b><code>scan_r = False</code></b>, the scan rate value (mV/s) will be directly read from the filename given that it is supplied in the format as specified above in the pathway section. If the current is not included the filename, it should be specified in the form of <code>scan_r =<i>specified_scan_rate</i></code>
        
        
        5. <b>row_skip : <i>int, optional</i></b><br>
           Number of the rows of headers to skip in the txt files. If <b><code>row_skip = False</code></b>, row_skip = 1; if <b><code>row_skip = True</code></b>, a prompt will ask for rows to skip for the file. Enter <code>row_skip = 0</code> if no rows need to be skipped. 
           
           
        6. <b>x_name : <i>int/str(csv files only), optional</i></b> <br>
           An integer specifying the coloumn index for voltage(V) data, with the first coloumn being coloumn 0 starting from left. If <code>x_name = False</code>, column 0 will be used as voltage(V); if x_name = True, there will be prompt asking for scan rate coloumn index to be entered.For csv files, the coloumn index can also be the name of the coloumn (e.g. <code>x_name = 'voltage(V)'</code>). 
             
             
        7. <b>y_name : <i>int/str(csv files only), optional</i></b> <br>
           An integer specifying the coloumn index for voltage(V) data, with the first coloumn being coloumn 0 starting from left. If <code>y_name = False</code>, column 1 will be used as current(mA); if y_name = True, there will be prompt asking for current coloumn index to be entered. For csv files, the coloumn index can also be the name of the coloumn (e.g. <code>y_name = 'current(mA)'</code>). 
        
        
        4. <b>delimiter : <i>str, optional</i></b> <br>
            A string which is used to seperate the data coloumns in the data file. If <code>delimiter = False</code>, the delimiter is assumed to be space <code>' '</code>.
        
        <div id="int_para"></div>
        
        5. <b>int_method : <i>int, optional</i></b> <br>
           The method for integration of the enclosed area. It is by default <b>(<code>int_method = False</code>)</b> that the ESR analysis will be carried out using method 2 (constant derivative). For all methods available please refer to the next session <a href="#int_method_table">int_method table</a>.

        Method  |  Description  |
        ---   |  ---   | 
        <b>False or 1</b>   |  Default method. Integration using the trapezoidal rule and integrates over discharging curve only.  |  
        <b>101</b>    |  Integration using the trapezoidal rule and integrates over both the charging and discharging curves.  |  
        <b>2</b>    |  Integration using the Simpson's rule and integrates over discharging curve only. |  
        <b>202</b>     |  Integration using the Simpson's rule and integrates over both the charging and discharging curves.   |
