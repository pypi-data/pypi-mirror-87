deprecations:
  - |
    The ``oslo_db.sqlalchemy.migration`` module is deprecated for removal.
    It only supports ``sqlalchemy-migrate``, which is no longer under active
    development and has been effectively replaced by ``alembic``. Users of
    this module should consider switching to ``alembic`` or, if necessary,
    using ``sqlalchemy-migrate`` directly.
  - |
    The ``oslo_db.sqlalchemy.migration_cli`` module is deprecated for removal.
    It was intended to provide an abstraction layer over different migration
    backends - specifically ``sqlalchemy-migrate`` and ``alembic`` - however,
    takeup has been limited and its expected that users will use ``alembic``
    directly nowadays.
