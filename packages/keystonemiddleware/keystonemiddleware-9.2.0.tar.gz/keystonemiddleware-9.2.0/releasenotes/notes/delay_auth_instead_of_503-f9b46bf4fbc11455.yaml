    When ``delay_auth_decision`` is enabled and a Keystone failure prevents
    a final decision about whether a token is valid or invalid, it will be
    marked invalid and the application will be responsible for a final auth
    decision. This is similar to what happens when a token is confirmed *not*
    valid. This allows a Keystone outage to only affect Keystone users in a
    multi-auth system.
