Options to control library behaviour

Notes
----------
If an option is also a function parameter, the here specified values are for fallback.

e. g. calling a.to_get_expr(as_latex=False) will return as non latex string even if options.as_latex=True
If nothing is specified the assumed value will be options.as_latex.

Working with library is far less error prone without correct gc. However correct gc massively improves memory usage.
Examples
----------
If True this

     a= evar(..)*10
     print(a.get_expr())
will fail.
However this

    a=evar(..)
    a*=10
    print(a.get_expr())
will not. All functions which retrieve expressions will have to resolve their dependencies.
In the first case the expression for a will be a = UnnamedVariable*10. Since UnnamedVariable has no direct reference 
anymore, it will be deleted. In the second case, as still has an exisiting reference and won't be deleted.
