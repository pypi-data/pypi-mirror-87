features:
  - |
    A new config option, ``openstackdocs_auto_version``, has been added. This
    can be used to disable auto-versioning of documentation for things like
    release notes or API references.
upgrade:
  - |
    The ``openstackdocs_auto_version`` option must be configured to disable
    auto-versioning of documentation. Previously, the extension would check for
    an empty string (``''``) and, if present, use this to indicate that the
    document should be unversioned. However, this only worked if building
    documentation using the ``build_sphinx`` distutils extension.
