    Parameters
    ----------
    distances: ndarray
        distance array, for which distances[i, j] is the distance from the ith to the jth point
    route: ndarray
        array of indices defining the path

def two_opt_swap(route, i, k):
    """
    Take everything the same up to i, then reverse i:k, then take k: normally.
    Parameters
    ----------
    route: ndarray
        Path to swap postions in
    i: int
        first swap index
    k: int
        second swap index
    Returns
    -------
    two-opt swapped route

    Notes
    -----
    Returns a copy. Temping to do something in place, e.g. route[i:k + 1] = route[k:i - 1: -1], but the algorithm
    seems to require a copy somewhere anyway, so might as well do it here.

def two_opt_test(route, i, k, distances, k_max):
    """
    Test to see what distance change we'd get doing a two_opt_swap.
    Take everything the same up to i, then reverse i:k, then take k: normally.


    Parameters
    ----------
    route: ndarray
        Path to swap postions in
    i: int
        first swap index
    k: int
        second swap index
    distances: NxN matrix of float
        distances between points
    k_max: pre-computed maximum value of k  == distances.shape[0] -1

    Returns
    -------
    distance change on swap

    Notes
    -----
    There is a cythonized version in two_opt_utils which is considerably faster.

    Parameters

    distances: ndarray
        distance array, which distances[i, j] is the distance from the ith to the jth point
    epsilon: float
