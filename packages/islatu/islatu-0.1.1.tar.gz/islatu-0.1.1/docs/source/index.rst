X-ray reflectometry reduction in Python
=======================================

:py:mod:`islatu` is an open-source pacakge for the reduction of x-ray reflectometry datasets.
Currently, :py:mod:`islatu` is developed at and supports data from `Diamond Light Source`_, however we are happy to work with others to enable data from other sources (including neutron sources).

These webpages include `API-level documentation`_ and information about some `workflows`_ that can be used for data reduction.
