	This function does nothing on non-Windows platforms (returns True,
	meaning "it's all good").
	
	On Windows, this function attempts to use the Windows API (via ctypes)
	to change the current process's "DPI awareness" flag to one of the
	following levels:
	
	0: I am not going to pretend to be DPI-aware: therefore, the operating
	   system will take over, and may scale my graphical output.
	1: I claim to be DPI aware, but will not claim to be committed to
	   continuous monitoring of potential changes in DPI scaling in future.
	   The OS will initially leave me alone (and things will be pixel-for-pixel)
	   but if screen resolution or scaling changes, then the OS may take over
	   again. (NB: this level may be the best we can achieve on Windows 7 or
	   Vista.)
	2: (default) I claim that I will be continuously DPI-aware throughout my 
	   whole lifetime, so the OS will leave me alone.  This is what we want to
	   aim for, for pixel-for-pixel control.
	
	The awareness level can only be successfully changed once per process lifetime,
	and this includes changes that the OS itself may make when it launches the,
	process, in response to an external .exe.manifest file or because of registry
	entries (created when you check "Disable DPI scaling" in the "Compatibility"
	tab of an .exe file's properties dialog).
	
	This function will return True if the awareness level was either successfully
	changed to, or is already at, the desired level.  It will return False if the
	process is not at, and cannot be switched to, the desired level.

def CheckRetinaScaling( screen=0, raiseException=False, adjust=None ):
	"""
	On non-Mac platforms, this function does nothing and returns `None`.
	
	On macOS, the function returns the pixel scaling factor for the
	screen designated by the zero-based integer index `screen`. For a
	non-Retina screen, this scaling factor will be 1.0, whereas for a
	Retina screen, the function performs a check to ensure that the
	resolution scaling in System Preferences -> Displays is set
	appropriately.  If it is not set appropriately, unfortunately there
	is no workaround: then the function will either print an error
	message to stderr, or (if called with `raiseException=True`) it
	will raise an exception.
	
	Currently the accelerated "ShaDyLib" windowing back-end uses version
	3.2.1 of the GLFW library, which is smart enough to cope with the
	difference between Retina and non-Retina screens, but only if the
	resolution scaling in System Preferences is set to enlarge things by
	exactly the factor dictated by the screen's `backingScaleFactor` 
	property (which is a property internal  to the Mac API). So far (as
	of 2018), Retina screens always have a factor of 2 here, and
	non-Retina screens have a factor of 1.
	
	This means that, if your Retina screen has 2560 x 1600 physical pixels
	for example, its scaling must be set to "Looks like 1280 x 800" in
	System Preferences. If this is not the case, we would end up inferring
	the wrong number of physical pixels and unfortunately there does not
	currently appear to be a way of programming around this in the macOS
	API (see https://stackoverflow.com/a/53712467/ ).
