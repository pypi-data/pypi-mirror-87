Description: 
        This package is a copy of pywigxjpf, https://pypi.org/project/pywigxjpf/. 
        Its purpose is to distribute binary wheels of pywixjpf for Windows users.
        
        The following text quotes the original pywigxjp package:
        
        WIGXJPF evaluates Wigner 3j, 6j and 9j symbols
        accurately using prime factorisation and multi-word integer arithmetic.
        
        Known issue
        -----------
        
        Please install pycparser first.

        Inline usage information
        ------------------------
        
        Available inline::
        
            import pywigxjpf as wig
            help(wig)                # For interfaces.
            help(wig.pywigxjpf)      # For usage information.
        
        Library usage
        -------------
        
        The python interface to wigxjpf uses cffi.
        
        Defines seven functions::
        
            wig_table_init(max_two_j,wigner_type)
            wig_table_free()
            wig_temp_init(max_two_j)
            wig_temp_free()
        
            wig3jj(jj1,jj2,jj3, mm1,mm2,mm3)
            wig6jj(jj1,jj2,jj3, jj4,jj5,jj6)
            wig9jj(jj1,jj2,jj3, jj4,jj5,jj6, jj7,jj8,jj9)
        
        Note that the arguments are to be given as integers, with
        twice the numeric value (this is what jj tries to indicate).
        I.e. half-integer arguments will be passed as odd integers.
        
        The two init functions must be called before evaluating any
        symbol.
        
        In addition, interfaces that take an array with the arguments
        are also provided::
        
            wig3jj_array([jj1,jj2,jj3, mm1,mm2,mm3])
            wig6jj_array([jj1,jj2,jj3, jj4,jj5,jj6])
            wig9jj_array([jj1,jj2,jj3, jj4,jj5,jj6, jj7,jj8,jj9])
