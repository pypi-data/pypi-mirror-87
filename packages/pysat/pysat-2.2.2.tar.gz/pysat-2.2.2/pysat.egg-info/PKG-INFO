Description: The Python Satellite Data Analysis Toolkit (pysat) is a package providing a simple and flexible interface
        for downloading, loading, cleaning, managing, processing, and analyzing scientific 
        measurements. Though pysat was initially designed for in-situ
        satellite based measurements it aims to support all instruments in space science.
        
        Main Features
        -------------
        - Instrument independent analysis routines.
        - Instrument object providing an interface for downloading and analyzing a wide variety of science data sets.
          - Uses pandas for the underlying data structure; capable of handling the many forms scientific measurements take in a consistent manner.
          - Science data pipeline tasks of identifying files, loading, cleaning, and modifying data sets are built into the instrument object.
          - Supports metadata consistent with the netCDF CF-1.6 standard. Each variable has a name, long name, and units. Note units are informational only.
        - Simplifies data management
          - Iterator support for loading data by day/file/orbit, independent of data storage details.
          - Orbits are calculated on the fly from loaded data and span day breaks.
          - Iterate over custom seasons
        - Supports rigorous time-series calculations that require spin up/down time across day/file breaks. 
        - Includes helper functions to reduce the barrier in adding new science instruments to pysat

        Optional External Requirements
        ------------------------------
        For data in netCDF format:
        
        - netCDF3 files may be loaded using SciPy alone
        
        - For netCDF4 files, Unidata netCDF libraries in C are required, along with
        - netCDF4 python package
