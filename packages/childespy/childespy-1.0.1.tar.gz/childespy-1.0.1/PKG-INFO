Description: # A Python API for childes-db
        
        The `childespy` package allows you to access data in the childes-db from Python. This removes the need to write complex SQL queries in order to get the information you want from the database.
        
        This package is a wrapper for the latest version of the `childesr` R package (https://github.com/langcog/childesr), so it requires the user to install R (>=3.6) on their machine. Instructions can be found here: https://www.r-project.org/.
        
        `childesr` has R [package dependencies, listed here](https://github.com/langcog/childesr/blob/master/DESCRIPTION), which `childespy` will automatically install.
        
        ## Import with pip
        This package is available through pip with `pip3 install childespy` and can be run with `import childespy`.
