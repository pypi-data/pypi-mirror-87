## Configuration

You will need an active Twilio account.  A free account is fine, but you will only be able to send to your own (verified) phone number. Make sure you go to `Phone Numbers` -> `Manage Numbers` and get your Twilio phone number; this should be your "from" number.

## Acknowledgements

Loosely based on [OctoPrint-EmailNotifier](https://github.com/anoved/OctoPrint-EmailNotifier). 

Uses [twilio-python](https://github.com/twilio/twilio-python) to send sms messages and [phonenumbers](https://github.com/daviddrysdale/python-phonenumbers) to clean them up.
