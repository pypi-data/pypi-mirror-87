Description: # anacreonlib
        
        This **unofficial** library provides a Python interface to the API of [Anacreon 3](https://anacreon.kronosaur.com), which is an online [4X](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4X) game produced by [Kronosaur Productions, LLC.](http://kronosaur.com/).
        
        ## Usage
        
        
        ### Authentication (version 1.0)
        
        ```python
        from anacreonlib import Anacreon
        
        api = Anacreon("Username", "Password")
        api.gameID = GAME_ID
        api.sovID = SOV_ID
        ```
        
        You can find `GAME_ID` by looking at the URL when you play Anacreon in your browser.  
        For example, when I play on my Era 4 Alpha empire, the url is `http://anacreon.kronosaur.com/trantor.hexm?gameID=4365595`. Therefore, the 
        game ID for the Era 4 Alpha is `4365595`
        
        Your `SOV_ID` is equal to 
        
        ```
        api.sovID = api.get_game_info()['userInfo']['sovereignID']
        ```
        
        Personally, I run this once and write down the result somewhere
        
        ### Getting all objects in the game
        
        ```python
        objects = api.get_objects()
        ```
        
        After this call, `objects` will be a `dict`, where the key is the ID of the object, and the value is a `dict` which 
        contains data specific to that object, such as resources contained in the object, which sovereign owns the object, etc. More information can be found on the wiki. 
        
        
        ## Rate Limits
        
        The API has rate limits which are detailed in [this Ministry record](https://ministry.kronosaur.com/record.hexm?id=79981). Beware that they apply to both any scripts you write AND the online client.
