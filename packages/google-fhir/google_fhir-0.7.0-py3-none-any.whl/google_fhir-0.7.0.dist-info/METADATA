# Google FhirProto

## Introduction
This is the Python3 distribution for Google [FhirProto](http://github.com/google/fhir).

FhirProto is Google's implementation of the [FHIR Standard](http://hl7.org/fhir/) for Health Care data using [Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers).  By leveraging Google’s core data storage format, FhirProto provides a type-safe, strongly validated FHIR format with cross-language support at a fraction of the size on disk, making it a great data model to develop your Health Care application on.  Structured Codes and Extensions guarantee that your data will be in the correct format.  Support for generating and validating against custom Implementation Guides allow you to customize FhirProto to your dataset and requirements.  Parsing and Printing libraries make it easy to go back and forth between FhirProto format and JSON.

## Getting Started

### Installation

You can install the Python3 distribution of FhirProto with for use with Python interpreters >=3.6, <3.9 using the [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) package manager. We strongly recommend installing into a Python3 virtual environment, such as [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html):
```sh
python3 -m venv fhir
source fhir/bin/activate

pip install --upgrade setuptools
pip install google-fhir
```

### Examples and Documentation
We think the best way to get an idea of how FhirProto works is to get in and start playing with it.  To that end, we provide [https://github.com/google/fhir-examples](https://github.com/google/fhir-examples). This repo contains a script for using [Synthea](https://github.com/synthetichealth/synthea) to create a synthetic FHIR JSON dataset, and then shows some examples of parsing, printing, validating, profiling and querying.  The repo also contains a [walkthrough](https://github.com/google/fhir-examples/blob/master/EXAMPLES.md) of many of the examples.

A Reference User Guide with in-depth descriptions of different concepts can be found [here](https://github.com/google/fhir-examples/blob/master/USERGUIDE.md).
