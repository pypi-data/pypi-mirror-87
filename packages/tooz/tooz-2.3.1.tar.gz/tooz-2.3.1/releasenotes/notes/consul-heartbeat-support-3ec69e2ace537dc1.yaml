    Added heartbeat supported to the Consul driver so that locks would remain locked
    instead of timing out on the first TTL. This can be considered both a feature and
    a bug fix because previously the Consul driver would only hold the lock for the
    first TTL and behind the scenes Consul would release it due to the lack of session
    updates. In order for the Consul driver to perform distributed locking properly
    you MUST utilize heartbeats!
