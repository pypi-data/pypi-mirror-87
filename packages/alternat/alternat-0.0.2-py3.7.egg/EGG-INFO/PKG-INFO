        **Generation**
        
        Generation offers convenience methods to generate alt-texts. It offers alternatives to generate the alt-texts.

        2. Clone this repo https://github.com/keplerlab/alternat.git 
        
        3. Change your directory to your cloned repo.
        
        4. Open terminal and run following commands
        ```
        cd <path-to-repo> //you need to be in your repo folder
        docker-compose build
        ```
        5. Start docker container using this command
        ```
        docker-compose up

        ### Installation using Anaconda python
        
        1. Create conda environment and install dependencies using environment.yml file
        
        ```
        conda env create -f environment.yml
        ```
        
        2. If you want to do image downloads from websites (collect step in alternat) using apify pupeeter you need to also first install nodejs and then goto folder apify. Run npm install:
        ```
        cd <repo_path>
        cd apify
        npm install
        ```
        
        ## Running generate task using command line:
        
        If you want to generate alternate text for any image or folder containing 
        multiple images, you can use Command line option which we call generation stage. 
        
        To run generation stage alone you can use following command: 
        
        ```
        # To run a single file, results will be collected under "results/generate"
        # The image extensions supported are: .jpg, .jpeg, .png.
        
        python app.py generate --output-dir-path=./results/ --input-image-file-path=./image.jpg    
        
        or
        
        # To run for entire directory, results will be collected under "results/generate"
        # The image extensions supported are: .jpg, .jpeg, .png.
        
        python app.py generate --input-dir-path=./DATADUMP/ --output-dir-path=./results
        
        or 
        
        # To generate alt-text using specific driver (like azure, google or open source)
        
        python app.py generate --output-dir-path=./results/ --input-image-file-path=./images_with_text/sample_images/Hotel-thumbnail.jpg --driver-config-file-path="./sample/sample_conf_generator_driver/azure.json"
        
        ```
        
        
        
        Sample images are located at images/sample_images
        
        ## Running collect task using command line:
        First stage is called collection stage, it can be used to crawl and download images from any website or website url, to run the collection stage use following commands:
        
        ```bash
            # To run the collection 
            python app.py collect --collect-using-apify <WEBSITE_URL> ./DATADUMP
            ```
