# django-eremaea2

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/matwey/django-eremaea2.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/matwey/django-eremaea2)
[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/django-eremaea2.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/django-eremaea2)

django-eremaea2 is a simple [Django] application to store and manage webcam image snapshots.
The application is built on top of [django-rest-framework] and provides REST API to access the files.

There are three kind of resources available through REST API interface.
A *collection* is a collection of *snapshots*.
A *snapshot* is image file in essence.
For any *snapshot* there is a *retention policy* associated with to specify how long store the file.

## Installation

The following prerequisites are required to operate django-eremaea2:
* [django-rest-framework] - powerful and flexible toolkit that makes it easy to build Web APIs.
* [dj-inmemorystorage] - a non-persistent in-memory data storage backend for Django (required for testing).

To use django-eremaea2 in your django project, include the following code into your ```settings.py```:
```
INSTALLED_APPS = (
     #...
    'rest_framework',
    'eremaea',
)
```

Into your ```urls.py``` you have to add the following:
```
urlpatterns = patterns('',
    #...
    url(r'^eremaea/', include('eremaea.urls')),
)
```

## Configuration
The whole configuration is stored into the project database, there is not separate dedicated config file.

The ```RetentionPolicy``` model has two parameters: a lookup field ```name``` and ```duration``` that specifies time-to-live for associated objects.
To perform actual cleanup a POST request to the endpoint ```http://example.com/eremaea/retention_policies/{name}/purge``` is required.
The ```Collection``` model has two parameters: a lookup field ```name``` and ```default_retention_policy```.
The ```Snapshot``` model has the following field: associated ```collection``` and ```retention_policy```, ```file``` object, and auto-now ```date```.
New images are uploaded by POST request to the endpoint ```http://example.com/eremaea/snapshots/?collection=collection_name&retention_policy=retention_policy_name```.
The latest query parameter is optional one.

The other ways to configure the application are Django fixtures, Django admin interface, [django-rest-framework] web browsable interface, and REST API itself.
