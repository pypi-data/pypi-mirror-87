#: Testing the accuracy of our "noisy-bit" dithering implementation
"""
This demo tests the accuracy of the "noisy-bit" dithering algorithm
(Allard & Faubert 2008) as implemented in our fragment shader.

A "uniform" canvas is rendered with each specified target DAC value
in turn.  After each is rendered, a function is called to capture
the screen and analyze its pixel content.  When the target DAC value
is an integer, the screen should be truly uniform and the error should
be zero.  When it is a non-integer value, only the integer values
immediately above and immediately below target should appear, and
the mean value across all pixels should be very close to the target.

		Render a "uniform" canvas with each specified target DAC value in

		We're going to use a slightly obscure trick to ensure correct
		scheduling: we'll register a Python "generator function" as the
		animation callback, instead of a regular function. A generator
		function is any function with the `yield` keyword in it.
		
		Unusually for an animation callback, there's no `t` argument.
		This is because the function will actually only be called once
		(on the first frame after it is registered) rather than repeatedly
		on every frame. What then happens is that whenever we hit a
		`yield` statement, we pop out of the function back into Shady's
		main loop. And when the next frame comes around, we pop back in
		again to resume the function where we left off. (If we ever needed
		to know the time inside the generator code, it's always available
		as `self.t` anyway.)
