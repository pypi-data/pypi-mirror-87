# sha
Check and get file hashes (using any algorithm)

## Installation

    $ pip install sha
## API

### check(fileName, expected, [options,] cb) / checkSync(filename, expected, [options])

Asynchronously check that `fileName` has a "hash" of `expected`.  The callback will be called with either `null` or an error (indicating that they did not match).

Options:

- algorithm: defaults to `sha1` and can be any of the algorithms supported by `crypto.createHash`

### get(fileName, [options,] cb) / getSync(filename, [options])

Asynchronously get the "hash" of `fileName`.  The callback will be called with an optional `error` object and the (lower cased) hex digest of the hash.

Options:

- algorithm: defaults to `sha1` and can be any of the algorithms supported by `crypto.createHash`

### stream(expected, [options])

Check the hash of a stream without ever buffering it.  This is a pass through stream so you can do things like:
