Description: # biogl
        A collection of (semi) useful small bioinformatics functions
        
        ## Usage with `pip`
        `python3 -m pip install biogl`
        
        Thereafter, within Python, you should be able to simply do `import biogl` to use.
        
        ## Using without `pip`:
        There are a variety of ways to use this module within other Python code, some of which are platform-dependent.
        
        On Linux, my preferred method is to simply add the location of the `biogl` directory to the `PYTHONPATH` environmental variable in your preferred shell. For example, if you are using Bash, simply add the following to your `~/.bashrc` file:
        
        ```
        export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:{biogl_directory_path}
        ```
