# these are the minimum packages needed in order to execute the pygeoprocessing build.
# Setuptools, wheel are from pep508.
# NOTE: GDAL is *not* require here because the compiled cython module will
# dynamically import GDAL via python's import system.  This behavior means
# that we can provide a much easier build experience so long as GDAL is
# available at runtime.
