However, with speed came an increased cost of fuel and externalities like environmental impact. Airlines began to focus on cost, accessibility, and customer experience. Diminishing engineering returns and \"good enough\" travel times led to a shift in the industry. The same will happen - and is happening - for the technological boom of the present moment, the internet. The internet of 2060 will not look radically different from the internet of today.",

One worry about brain simulations is whether we need to understand the brain in order to properly simulate it. We know so little about the parts of the brain and how they interact that one could argue the simulation project is doomed. Another concern is whether we even know when we will have succeeded.

You can represent a square tiling (with no information lost) using a graph where horizontal lines become vertices, vertical lines become faces of the graph, and squares of the square tiling become edges in the graph. The value at one graph vertex is the average of the neighbors. By turning the square tiling by 90 degrees and performing the same operation we get the dual graph of the original graph (vertices and faces are swapped). The harmonic function applied to the graph shows that the square edge heights in the tiling can be averaged to get other edge heights. This function can be applied to a graph, giving a discrete function, but as the number of graph vertices grows to infinity, as the tiling covers the whole plane, the harmonic function becomes continuous. A lot of physics is about taking things that are discrete at the micro level and discovering properties of the continuous function at macro levels.",

Starting with an intuitive explanation can help the math come across more easily when you dive into the complex, intimidating formalisms. The same goes for neural nets (video #2) Relevance - whether people believe math is useful - can definitely make people engage with math, but it's not the full picture. Colliding blocks counting out pi and whether a random tetrahedron inside a sphere contains the center of that sphere (videos #3 and #1) seem completely useless. Math made useful is like going to the gym, it's not fun but you know what you're getting for it. You don't ask when Harry Potter spells will be useful. Fiction isn't useful, but it's still compelling. G.H. Hardy - trivial mathematics is much more useful than complex math. The most popular math communicators leverage the power of story. Imagining you could solve the hardest problem on the hardest test puts you in the shoes of a math protagonist. Compelling math comes from intertwining usefulness and good storytelling.",

The two go back and forth on the case of Tiger Woods, where he is the most responsible person in the world for missing an easy putt (given how much control he has) and yet his missing a putt actually says the least about him.

He debated \"Dark Profiles\" where people could set up placeholder accounts for their friends and family, a feature which would be seriously considered among Facebook employees for a time. Feed was released as \"News Feed\" and users loudly expressed disaproval about the felt decline in privacy, with the most private personal updates hitting others' News Feeds like tabloids. However, usage numbers told a different story with time-on-site skyrocketing - the personalized recommendations would become a core part of the platform. A controversial feature \"Beacon\" tracked - and then broadcast - purchases on the web.

It's possible that the balls would sort themselves spontaneously, but it's so unlikely that we never see it. Time can be considered an emergent property of this statistical fact. Time could go in reverse, but it's statistically so unlikely that it never does so in practice.",

The left size is when the hypothesis is true, the right side when the hypothesis is false.

The note above the tonic, D in the key of C for example, will be consonant with any diatonic chord. It's also just one note away from two other notes that are very easy to resolve to. Many pop songs will repeat the supertonic and easily resolve at any moment to either the tonic or the mediant. The Weeknd may do this more often than any other popular modern artist, but recent music by Post Malone, Katy Perry, Haim, Rhihanna, Justin Timberlake, Zedd, Daft Punk, Taylor Swift, DNCE, The 1975, Glass Animals, Dua Lipa, and Jacob Collier also uses the same technique.",

Overlaying two Penrose tilings shows Moire patterns of interference that gives some intuitive evidence for aperiodicity. Another two-tile aperiodic tiling uses kites and darts rather than pentagons, rhombuses, and crowns. While there is one set of rules for a Penrose tiling, there exists an uncountably large number of possible tilings. Because each tiling is infinite you can't prove whether one section of a tiling is taken from a different section of another. The ratio of kites to darts approaches the golden ratio, which is closely related to the five-fold symmetry in the Penrose pattern. While crystals can form locally, Penrose tilings require long-range coordination, so people thought that natural crystals couldn't form this way. However these structures have been created experimentally and are now called quasi-crystals.",

It is an unstable equilibrium where some perturbation on the surface of the liquid allows gravity to pull the liquid down starting from that initial site. However, if you vibrate the jar at the right frequency, the liquid will stay in place. This can be understood by analogy to an upside-down pendulum. A downward acceleration on an upside-down pendulum will apply a torque toward the equilibrium position. The opposite upward acceleration applies a torque away from the equilibrium position, but that torque is smaller as the pendulum is more upright after the first torque was applied. In the liquid experiment, the downward acceleration of the liquid causes the surface to flatten and the upload acceleration exaggerates perturbations, but less than the flattening. This results in a ratcheting effect and turns the unstable equilibrium into a stable equilibrium.",

Python is an exception that has just gained popularity slowly over time by being well-designed. How easy it is to migrate to a new language is also important, but not the thing that really catapults a language into the top ten. What makes an OO language OO? Inheritance? Methods? Modules? It's not clear exactly what makes an OO language OO. But inheritance is not considered a best practice (composition over inheritance). Methods are really just syntactic sugar around structs and functions. Many languages have module systems with information hiding. Before Stroustrup made C++ he made \"C with classes\" which didn't do well. When he added a ton more features, then C++ did well. The success of OO languages seems to be an accident of history.",

But we've never been able to measure the one way speed of light because you would need two clocks perfectly synchronized in two places which we can't do because of general relativity.

While information silos can cause ideogological differences, what they create more of are differences in how we use language, leading to groups talking past each other. Machine learning is just one piece of AI and one important thing ML misses is being intelligent around other intelligent beings, social learning. Being intelligent alone is meaningless. Both research and industry have short term incentives; In order to get at real intelligence we'll need to take some risks and put an agent out in the chaotic world for an extended period of time. Google didn't come out of no where to solve the question answering problem. They actually changed the problem to minimize false positives given many potential answers. Google doesn't have to give THE answer, just a few high probability answers ranked above lower ones. And then humans had to train to query effectively. The same problem exists in hiring professors: adding noise to your search is too expensive, so you have to just widen your pool of applicants to have a higher chance to find someone good. Tenure isn't a test it's a training process. Ranking colleges on anything other than prestige/narrative is impossible. Academic disciplines give you mindsets, ways of seeing/interacting with the world. Computing as a mindset teaches that models/machines/languages/abstractions/analogies are all connected. Computing will eventually seep into all other disciplines and in turn those disciplines will inform computing. People don't need to code, just learn the precision of communication that coding teaches. Computing is a way to surface assumptions. Assumptions are neural net parameters and programming language if/thens. Race relations have changed recently because of increased transparency and more people are willing to believe how bad things are. Violence is the voice of the unheard and the unfortunate truth is that violence effectively creates change.",

There are actually a total of 26 fundamental constants along with the fine structure constant that are dimensionless. 25 of these come from the standard model. The 26th comes from general relativity. The \"cosmological constant\", the energy density of empty space, vacuum energy, is related to the expansion of space and dark energy.
