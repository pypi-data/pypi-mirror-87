Riverbed SteelScript
====================

Riverbed SteelScript is a collection of libraries and scripts written in Python for interacting
with Riverbed solutions and appliances, and other network infrastructure devices.

For a complete guide with installation details, see:

  `https://support.riverbed.com/apis/steelscript <https://support.riverbed.com/apis/steelscript>`_

**Recommendation**: Use SteelScript in a Docker container or directly from the python source code in Github!

Contribute
-----------

Feel free to use, enhance and contribute by creating issues, sending pull requests (PR), extending with new modules ...

Quick Start 
-----------

If you have git and Docker installed.
Open your shell (bash or PowerShell), build SteelScript from the latest source code and run it locally in a Docker container as follows:

.. code:: shell

  # Fetch the code and build a docker image
  git clone https://github.com/riverbed/steelscript.git
  cd steelscript
  docker build --tag steelscript:latest .
  
  # Run the image in an interactive container
  docker run -it steelscript:latest /bin/bash
  
From here you can start to use the SteelScript framework.

You can try some app examples like printing the Host Groups of an AppResponse appliance:

.. code:: shell

  python /examples/appresponse-examples/hostgroup.py appliance-ip-address -u admin -p password --operation=show
  

Python Compatibility Note
-------------------------

The SteelScript 2.x series of packages support Python 3. The 1.8.X series of SteelScript packages are the last to support
Python 2.


Framework
=========

The common module for SteelScript is in the `SteelScript repo <https://github.com/riverbed/steelscript>`__
It contains common code but also it is the entrypoint for Documentation, Build, Test and releases.

Other SteelScript modules have their own repository which
can be found in the `Riverbed GitHub org <https://github.com/riverbed>`__, the name is prefixed by "steelscript".

Modules for Riverbed solutions and appliances:

- `AppResponse <https://github.com/riverbed/steelscript-appresponse>`__
- `NetProfiler <https://github.com/riverbed/steelscript-netprofiler>`__
- `Packets <https://github.com/riverbed/steelscript-packets>`__
- `SteelHead <https://github.com/riverbed/steelscript-steelhead>`__
- `SteelHead Controller (a.k.a SCC) <https://github.com/riverbed/steelscript-scc>`__
- `Wireshark <https://github.com/riverbed/steelscript-wireshark>`__
- `NetShark <https://github.com/riverbed/steelscript-netshark>`__

Extra modules

- `Command line Access <https://github.com/riverbed/steelscript-cmdline>`__

Other repos for components and SteelScript extensions:

- `Application Framework <https://github.com/riverbed/steelscript-appfwk>`__
- `- Business hour reporting plugin for Application Framework <https://github.com/riverbed/steelscript-appfwk-business-hours>`__
- `- Stock report demo with Application Framework <https://github.com/riverbed/steelscript-appfwk-business-hours>`__
- `VM Config <https://github.com/riverbed/steelscript-vm-config>`__ 

Folder Structure for Modules
----------------------------

The repos of SteelScript modules have a common structure 

Mandatory:

- README.rst: simple description using reStructured Text (rst) file format
- setup.py: Python setup file containing meta descriptions and requirements. Based on setuptools, distutils, gitpy-versioning (custom versioning tool https://github.com/riverbed/gitpy-versioning) and pytest. Should NOT contain unit test (use Tox and put unit test inside /tests folder instead)
- /docs: Documentation using reStructured Text (rst) file format.
- /steelscript: The actual code, written in Python. Must be Python3 only.
- /tests: Test plans and unit test. Can be organized in subfolders. Test plan are ideally documented and easy to run scripts but can be anything defining a test plan (script, text, ...), for example a python script based on pytest.
- /examples: Python scripts samples showing how to use the module.
- CHANGELOG: Simple text file tracking major changes
- LICENSE: Riverbed Technology copyright, terms and conditions based on MIT

Optional:

- /tox.ini: standardized python testing definition based on `Tox <https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__
- /notebooks: Notebooks based on `Jupyter <https://jupyter.org/>`__

Build
-----

Build are defined in the `SteelScript repo <https://github.com/riverbed/steelscript>`__ 

**Prebuild test-plans validations**

*todo*

Execute test-plans with tox

.. code:: shell

  pip install tox
  tox
 
**Building Docker containers**

3 Dockerfile are available to build different flavors of the SteelScript container image:

- Dockerfile: standard build
- Dockerfile-slim: optimized build
- Dockerfile-notebook: build for demo and learning with Notebooks

In the following code snippet just replace {{version}} with the actual version and run to get it built.

Standard:

.. code:: shell

  docker build --tag steelscript:{{version}} -f Dockerfile .

Slim:

.. code:: shell

  docker build --tag steelscript-slim:{{version}} -f Dockerfile-slim .

Notebook

.. code:: shell

  docker build --tag steelscript-notebook:{{version}} -f Dockerfile-notebook .


Distribution
------------

The recommendation is to use SteelScript in a Docker container or install directly from the python code publicly available in Github.
In the `SteelScripts docs <https://support.riverbed.com/apis/steelscript>`__ there are more details about other installation methods but Docker is the easiest.

The goal is to be able to release each new version (corresponding to a tag in the master branch) at least in a Docker public repository: `SteelScript on Docker Hub <https://hub.docker.com/r/riverbed/steelscript>`__

For contribution for alternative distribution methods and packaging (like pypi, rpm, .deb, rpm, tgz,...), artifacts will be organized inside /packaging and /test subfolders. We might need to dedicate another repo.
