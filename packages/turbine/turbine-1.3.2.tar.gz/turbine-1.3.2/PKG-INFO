Description: # Turbine
        A Python 3 tool to harness the google cloud to run shell scripts. In particular, if you have
        1. a docker image and
        2. many independent, idempotent tasks for that image written as shell scripts,
        
        Turbine allows you to run those tasks on many VMs in parallel on GCE. See [this jupyter notebook](https://github.com/Kasekopf/Turbine/blob/master/example/example_usage.ipynb) for detailed usage.
        
        Turbine is a lot like
        * [Google Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run/) except you don't need to hit an HTTP endpoint and it supports large machine types and accelerators;
        * [Google Cloud Functions](https://cloud.google.com/functions/) except it supports large machine types and accelerators; and
        * [Batch on GKE](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/batch/running-job) except I understand it, it is significantly lighter-weight than Kubernetes, and it provides a path for TPU access.
        
        # Installation
        Turbine consists of two components:
        1. A controller on the local machine to setup cloud components, enter tasks, and provision VMs.
        2. A small shim to run inside of the docker image and retrieve tasks.
        
        For most users, the recommended method to install the controller is via pip:
        
        ```
        pip install turbine
        ```
        
        To attach turbine to a docker image, simply install turbine on the image via pip:
        ```
        RUN pip install turbine
        ```
        
        Note that the `ENTRYPOINT` of the docker image will be overwritten when used by the Turbine controller.
        
        ## Dependencies:
        * google-cloud-pubsub
        * google-cloud-storage
        * google-cloud-logging
        * google-api-python-client
