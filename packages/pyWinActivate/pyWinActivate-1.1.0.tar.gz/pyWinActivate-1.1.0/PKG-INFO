Description: # pyWinActivate
        
        ## Just like WinActivate in AutoHotkey, this module lets you easily activate and focus an opened window.
        
        
        ### Examples
        ```py
        from pyWinActivateCopy import win_activate, win_wait_active
        
        
        # Activate window with partial winTitle string.
        win_activate(window="Book1", titlematchmode=1)
        
        
        # Activate window with exact winTitle string.
        win_activate(window="Book1.xlsx - Excel", titlematchmode=0)
        
        
        
        
        # Wait for the specified window to be active.
        # You can pass an exception for a popup window's title. If not needed leave as None or skip entirely.
        # Note: works only with a full title
        win_wait_active(win_to_wait=Book1.xlsx - Excel, exception="potential popup window", message=False)
        
        ```
