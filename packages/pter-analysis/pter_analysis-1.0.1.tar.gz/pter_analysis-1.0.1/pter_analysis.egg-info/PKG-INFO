Description: 
        ``apter`` is a complementary analysis tool to the todotxt handler ``pter``. If certain tags are consequently used in tasks several statistics and distributions can be calculated using ``apter`` such as:
        
        * Estimated time left per project
        * Estimated workload for completing all tasks in ``pter`` search(es)
        * Task estimation accuracy
        * Task delay (usage of the ``t:`` tag) or task completion time (``completed`` before or after ``due:`` tag) distributions
        
        And much more...
