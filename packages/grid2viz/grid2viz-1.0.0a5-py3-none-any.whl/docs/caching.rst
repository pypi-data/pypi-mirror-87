Caching
*******

The cache system allows you to only compute long calculations of the app once per agent/scenario.
The app will create a folder `_cache` in the `base_dir` of the config.ini which will contain these long calculations serialized.

If you add a new folder in your `base_dir` (either an agent, or a scenario) you will have to restart the server so the app
reads the folder tree again.

**_WARNING_** : If you overwrite the agents while they were already cached, you will have to manually reset the cache so the app
knows to compute everything again with the updated data. To do so, you just need to delete the `_cache` folder.
