Description: # gitto
        Automate git commits.
        
        A minuscle python package to automate:
        ```
        git add .
        git commit -m bump
        git push
        ```
        
        ### Installation
        ```
        pip install gitto
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        From the command line, in a git repository:
        ```
        gitto -m commit_name -f file1 file2 file3 -p
        ```
        
        Both `-m` (commit message) and `-f` (committed files) are **optional**.
        If `-m` is omitted the commit will be called "bump", if `-f` is omitted **all** changed files will be added to the commit. 
        
        If `-p` is omitted, the commit will be staged but not pushed to the upstream branch.
        
        
        
        The results might look something like:
        <br>
        <img src="img.PNG" width="400px"></img>
        
        That's it!
