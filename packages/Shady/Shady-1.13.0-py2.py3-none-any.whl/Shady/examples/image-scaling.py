#: Demonstrates interpolated and non-interpolated image scaling
"""
This demo displays two well-known images whose interpretation
depends on their scaling, and allows you to manipulate scaling
using the `-` and `+` keys.

This demo requires the third-party package `numpy`.

	The following dynamic property assignment will ensure
	the two images are always scaled to the same height.
	(We cannot use the more-efficient mechanism of property
	sharing here, since `.scaledHeight` is not a fully-
	fledged `ManagedProperty`, but the dynamic will do
	fine.) Since the default value of `.scaledAspectRatio`
	is `'fixed'`, the `.scaledWidth` property will be
	automatically adjusted to preserve aspect ratio.
	"""#:
	s2.scaledHeight = lambda t: s.scaledHeight
	
	"""
	Finally we'll install an event handler for manipulating
	the images via the keyboard:
	"""#:
	@w.EventHandler( slot=-1 )
	def eh( self, event ):

			s.linearMagnification = not s.linearMagnification
		if event >> "kp[+] ka[+] kp[=] ka[=]":
			s.scale = min( maxScale, round( min( s.scale ) ) + 1 )
		if event >> "kp[-] ka[-]":
			s.scale = max( 1, round( min( s.scale ) ) - 1 )
