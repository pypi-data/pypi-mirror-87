    Adds the option to configure the display of a version selector dropdown
    menu for the most recent five git tags used as release indicators for the repository.
    By default, in ``theme.conf``, the ``show_other_versions`` value is set to
    False.
    In ``conf.py``, set the theme variable, ``html_theme_options`` to
    include the parameter, ``show_other_versions`` as ``True``. For
    example:

    ::

      html_theme_options = {'show_other_versions': True}

  - Publishes a version dropdown menu in the "Updated" date row, on both mobile
    and desktop views, where the version list is imported from git tags on the
    repository.
