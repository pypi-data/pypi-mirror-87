Description: # twinpics
        
        ## Introduction
        
        Social Media Prediction Model
        
        ## Installation
        
        In order to get this package working you will need to **install it via pip** (with a Python3.5 version or higher) on the terminal by typing:
        
        ``$ pip install twinpics``
        
        Additionally, **if you want to use the latest version instead of the stable one**, you can just use the following command:
        
        ``$ pip install git+https://github.com/albMart/Twinpics.git@developer``
        
        **The developer branch ensures the user that the most updated version will always be the working and fully operative** so as not to wait until the stable release on the master branch comes out (which eventually may take some time depending on the amount of issues to solve).
        
        ## Documentation
        
        You can find the **complete developer documentation** at: https://twinpics.readthedocs.io/, hosted on [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org/) and generated using [sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) with the theme [sphinx_rtd_theme](https://github.com/readthedocs/sphinx_rtd_theme) which is the standard Read the Docs theme for sphinx.
        
        ## Usage
        
        So as to use this Python package, a sample piece of code is presented below:
        
        ```python
        import twinpics
        
        twinpics.sample_function()
        ```
        
        So on, the previous piece of code outputs the following line:
        
        ```{r, engine='python', count_lines}
        "This is a sample function"
        ```
        
        ## Contribute
        
        As this is an open source project it is **open to contributions, bug reports, bug fixes, documentation improvements, enhancements and ideas**. There is an open tab of [issues](https://github.com/albMart/Twinpics/issues) where anyone can open new issues if needed or navigate through them in order to solve them or contribute to its solving. Remember that **issues are not threads to describe multiple problems**, this does not mean that issues can't be discussed, but so to keep a structured project management, the same issue should not describe different problems, just the main one and some nested/related errors that may be found.
