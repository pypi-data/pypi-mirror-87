#: Testing the properties of our GPU-side random number generator
"""
This demo tests properties of the random-number generator (RNG)
in our fragment shader.  Since we want independent random values
generated for each pixel, and the fragment shader processes pixels
in parallel without being able to pass a state from one to the
other, building a good RNG is a challenge.

This test generates a screen full of dynamic noise until the user
presses a key. Then it takes a screenshot, closes down the World,
and plots (assuming you have matplotlib installed) a histogram of
the screenshot pixel values.

Results are easiest to interpret when the noise is generated without
any gamma correction. The test can be parameterized using the --bg
and --noise command-line parameters, which affect the
`Stimulus.backgroundColor` and `Stimulus.noiseAmplitude` of the
canvas, respectively.

If your graphics card, drivers and operating system make GLSL 3.3+
shader functions available (which is the case on most of the modern
Windows systems we have tested) then our RNG is of pretty good
quality.  If these functions are not available, then the histograms
are not quite as beautiful and there will sometimes be detectable
structure in the noise---this is the case on macOS by default,
because macOS does not allow legacy GLSL 1.2 code to be mixed with
more modern OpenGL code. On macOS, it may therefore be worth
explicitly disabling legacy OpenGL features with the constructor
argument `legacy=False` (compare the results of this demo with
the `--legacy=False` command-line option vs `--legacy=True`).
