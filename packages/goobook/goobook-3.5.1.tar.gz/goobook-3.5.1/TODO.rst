Things than I plan to do
========================

Don't sit in in front of your computer waiting for these,
If you got an idea or want to give me a nudge about one
of these, please let me know. Of course patches are always welcome.


Ideas
=====

- Use primary email when sending to groups.
- Make it possible to configure goobook to read dumps instead of calling Google.
- Make it configurable only to search contacts in a specified group.
- Optimize speed when doing queries on big datasets.
- add: allow non quoted multi word names "goobook add Christer Sj√∂holm hcs@furuvik.net"
- add: check if the email already is in the contacts, also add a force flag to bypass check.
- add/edit interface:
  A prompting interface, like a wizard for adding.
  Something like "git add --interactive".
- export/import commands that can be used with another program for
  updating contacts. Primarily for batch processing of contacts.
- chain search apps? A wrapper (reduce) is probably better.
- async cache updates
