Description: More Collections
        ================
        
        Some useful data structures for collections of data
        
        
        ### Class `Index`
        
        Provide indexing for a list. Inner properties can be used for keys, and keys can be tuples of properties.  
        
        ### Class `UniqueIndex`
        
        Same as Index, but includes checks and optimization to ensure members' keys are unique.
        
        ### Class `Queue`
        
        A `Queue` is a list, with `add()` and `pop()`. It ensures members in the queue are not duplicated by not adding the ones already found in the queue.
        
        ### Class `Matrix`
        
        A multidimensional grid of values that can be used like a `Mapping` from a-tuple-of-coordinates to the value at that coordinate. Plus a few other convenience methods.
        
        This is a naive implementation. The hope it is a simple facade to a faster implementation.
        
        ### Class `Relation`
        
        Store the many-to-many relations between two domains
