    NLP Sandbox Data Node API

    The OpenAPI specification implemented by NLP Sandbox Data Nodes. # Overview A NLP Sandbox Data Node is a repository of clinical notes that implements this OpenAPI specification so that other services in the NLP Sandbox ecosystem can access them. For example, a client requests data from a Data Node before passing them as input to an NLP Tool like a Date Annotator, Person Name Annotator, etc. For the sake of benchmarking NLP Tool, a Data Node can also give access to the gold standard that the NLP Tool is expected to infer (e.g. annotations).   # noqa: E501

    The version of the OpenAPI document: 0.2.2
