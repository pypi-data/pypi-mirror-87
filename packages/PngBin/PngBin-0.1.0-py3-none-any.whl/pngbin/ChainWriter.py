# Use this class to create multiple PngBin image files and write like they are just a single image.
#
# This class uses either Writer or EncryptWriter as a writer class based on `encrypt` parameter.
# This means most of the requirements are going to be the same as those classes.
# One more difference of this class to other 2 writer classes is
# this class will not write anything until the first write(data) method has been called.

# Note: don't forget to call finish() after you're done writing, or use context manager (`with` clause).
