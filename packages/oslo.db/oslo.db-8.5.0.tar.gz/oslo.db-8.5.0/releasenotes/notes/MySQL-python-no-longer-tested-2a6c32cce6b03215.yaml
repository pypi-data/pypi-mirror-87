    PyMySQL is a default MySQL DB API driver for oslo.db, as well as for the whole
    OpenStack. So far it was possible to use MySQL-python as an alternative DB API driver.
    This driver is no longer being tested in this release, hence it should be considered
    unsupported. Please switch to PyMySQL, which is an adequate replacement. Refer to
    https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/PyMySQL_evaluation for details.
