        # Install applications using conda
        
        Tiny conda extension (actually a commandline tool using conda) to install
        applications.
        
        The main advantages are:
        
        - very simple **cross-platform** installation commands for Windows, macOS and
          Linux (and different shells, as bash, fish and zsh).
        
        - the applications are installed in isolated conda environments.
        
        - commands provided by the applications are available system-wide, i.e. when
          the associated conda environment is not activated.
        
        ## Installation of conda-app
        
        conda-app needs to be installed in the `base` conda environment:
        
        ```bash
        conda activate base
        pip install conda-app
        ```
        
        -----------
        **Warning**
        
        Note that conda-app needs Python >= 3.6, so if your base environment still uses
        Python 2.7, you first need to update it with `conda update conda` and `conda
        install python=3`.
        
        -----------
        
        ## Example
        
        With the conda-forge channel added (`conda config --add channels conda-forge`),
        one should be able to install Mercurial (plus few important extensions) with:
        
        ```bash
        conda-app install mercurial
        ```
        
        This should also work:
        
        ```bash
        conda-app list
        conda-app uninstall mercurial
        ```
        
        **Open a new terminal** (on Windows, the "Conda Prompt") and the Mercurial
        command `hg` should be available.
