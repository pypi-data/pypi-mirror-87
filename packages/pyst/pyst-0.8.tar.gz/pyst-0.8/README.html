<div class="document" id="pyst-a-python-interface-to-asterisk">
<h1 class="title">pyst: A Python Interface to Asterisk</h1>

<p>Pyst consists of a set of interfaces and libraries to allow programming of
Asterisk from python. The library currently supports AGI, AMI, and the parsing
of Asterisk configuration files. The library also includes debugging facilities
for AGI.</p>
<p>News 2020: Updated to Python3 including Py7 which includes a new 'async'
keyword that was used in the code. Note that there is a pyst2 project
also on github which is a fork from an earlier version of pyst.
Unfortunately the fork was made from the old Subversion repository and
therefore the two repos do not share a common root in git which makes it
hard to merge changes. Also I've introduced a regression test since then
which afaik is not included in pyst2. The maintainers seem to have tried
to contact me via Sourceforge but this may not have worked at the time
due to problems forwarding mails by SF. This should no longer happen as
in GIT every commit from me contains my correct email address now.</p>
<p>So far I've tried to be compatible with the mentioned change of the
async keyword so that the API will not diverge too much. Note that there
is one ad-hoc patch in pyst2 that breaks the old API:</p>
<p>Newer versions of Asterisk now send the output of AMI commands prefixed
with <tt class="docutils literal">Output:</tt>.  With my version this fits nicely into the
already-implemented <tt class="docutils literal">multiheaders</tt> variable where Lines with a
repeated header are kept.  So all the <tt class="docutils literal">Output:</tt> lines already were
correctly parsed and put into <tt class="docutils literal">self.multiheaders ['Output']</tt>. The only
thing I had to fix was to put all these lines into the old <tt class="docutils literal">data</tt>
variable, too. So if you were using <tt class="docutils literal">data</tt> with old versions of
asterisk your code continues to work with pyst. Conversely pyst2 has a
patch that will return <tt class="docutils literal">data</tt> prefixed with <tt class="docutils literal">Output:</tt> (untested,
this is how I read the code).</p>
<p>When I have time I intend to graft the pyst2 repo onto my working copy
(probably using <a class="reference external" href="http://www.catb.org/esr/reposurgeon/">reposurgeon</a>) and look through the changes that are
interesting. Drop me a note if you find something in pyst2 that you
think should be in pyst.</p>
<p>Github repo can be cloned with:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
git clone https://github.com/schlatterbeck/pyst.git
</pre>
<p>Old News: The source code is now in a GIT repository on Sourceforge.
To check out anonymously into the local directory <tt class="docutils literal">pyst</tt>, use:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
git clone git://git.code.sf.net/p/pyst/code pyst
</pre>
<p>Update 2020: I will continue to push to the sourceforge repository, too.</p>
<p>Thanks to Eric S. Raymond's <a class="reference external" href="http://www.catb.org/esr/reposurgeon/">reposurgeon</a>, it was possible to unite the
old CVS repository, the monotone repository used until 0.2 (and a little
beyond 0.2) and the recent subversion repository into one git repository
that contains the whole history and cleans up some artefacts.</p>
<p>A note on maintenance and forks:
The current maintainer is Ralf Schlatterbeck. I've contacted maintainers
of forks to try to join forces. For any questions, please contact me via
<a class="reference external" href="mailto:rsc&#64;runtux.com">rsc&#64;runtux.com</a> or my sourceforge user.</p>
<p>Download from <a class="reference external" href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/pyst/">Sourceforge project page</a>.</p>
<p>Installation is the standard python install:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
tar xvf pyst.tar.gz
cd pyst
python setup.py install --prefix=/usr/local
</pre>
<p>Documentation is currently only in python docstrings, you can use
pythons built-in help facility:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
import asterisk
help (asterisk)
import asterisk.agi
help (asterisk.agi)
import asterisk.manager
help (asterisk.manager)
import asterisk.config
help (asterisk.config)
</pre>
<p>Some notes on platforms: We now specify &quot;platforms = 'Any'&quot; in
<tt class="docutils literal">setup.py</tt>. This means, the manager part of the package will probably
run on any platform. The agi scripts on the other hand are called
directly on the host where Asterisk is running in which case they are
limited to the platforms asterisk is running on. Alternatively, you can
use the <em>fastagi</em> mechanism of asterisk which calls the agi scripts on a
remote host. In the latter case this host can be any platform where
python runs.</p>

<div class="section" id="things-to-do-for-pyst">
<h1>Things to do for pyst</h1>
<p>This is the original changelog merged into the readme file. I'm not so
sure I really want to change all these things (in particular the
threaded implementation looks good to me). I will maintain a section
summarizing the changes in this README, the ChangeLog won't be
maintained any longer. Detailed changes will be available in the version
control tool.</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">ChangeLog:
The ChangeLog needs to be updated from the monotone logs.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Documentation:
All of pyst's inline documentation needs to be updated.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">manager.py:
This should be converted to be single threaded.  Also there is a race
condition when a user calls manager.logoff() followed by
manager.close().  The close() function may still call logoff again if
the socket thread has not yet cleared the _connected flag.</p>
<p>A class should be made for each manager action rather than having a
function in a manager class.  The manager class should be adapted to
have a send method that know the general format of the classes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Matthew Nicholson writes on the mailinglist (note that I'm not sure I'll do
this, I'm currently satisfied with the threaded implementation):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For pyst 0.3 I am planning to clean up the manager.py.  There are
several know issues with the code.  No one has actually reported these
as problems, but I have personally had trouble with these.  Currently
manager.py runs in several threads, the main program thread, a thread to
read from the network, and an event distribution thread.  This causes
problems with non thread safe code such as the MySQLdb libraries.  This
design also causes problems when an event handler throws an exception
that causes the event processing thread to terminate.</p>
<p>The second problem is with the way actions are sent.  Each action has a
specific function associated with it in the manager object that takes
all possible arguments that may ever be passed to that action.  This
makes the api somewhat rigid and the Manager object cluttered.</p>
<p>To solve these problems I am basically going to copy the design of my
Astxx manager library (written in c++) and make it more python like.
Each action will be a different object with certain methods to handle
various tasks, with one function in the actual Manager class to send the
action.  This will make the Manager class much smaller and much more
flexible.  The current code will be consolidated into a single threaded
design with hooks to have the library process events and such.  These
hooks will be called from the host application's main loop.</p>

<div class="section" id="source-code-repository-access">
<h1>Source Code Repository Access</h1>
<p>The current versions are kept in a GIT repository on Github.
You can check out the trunk with:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
git clone https://github.com/schlatterbeck/pyst.git
</pre>
<p>I will continue to push to the Sourceforge version although Bug-Reports
etc. are easier with Github. Check out from Sourceforge with:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
git clone git://git.code.sf.net/p/pyst/code pyst
</pre>
<p>There is a monotone-after-0.2 branch which contains unreleased changes
after 0.2 which were committed to the monotone repository after the
Release of Version 0.2 (which have been merged into trunk <em>after</em>
changing how manager commands to asterisk are parsed).</p>
<p>Released versions are tagged, see the tags in the web-interface on
Sourceforge (or use local git commands to find out)</p>
<blockquote>
<a class="reference external" href="https://sourceforge.net/p/pyst/code/ci/master/tree/">https://sourceforge.net/p/pyst/code/ci/master/tree/</a></blockquote>
<p>For versions up to 0.6 the code was kept in a Subversion repository in
Sourceforge. This has been incorporated into the current GIT repository
(after cleaning up some subversion artefacts).</p>
<p>For versions prior to the 0.2 release when Matthew Nicholson was
maintaining pyst, the changes were kept in a <a class="reference external" href="http://monotone.ca/">monotone</a> repository
(monotone is a free distributed version control system). This repository
has also been incorporated into the GIT repository.</p>
<p>prior to that the sources are in the CVS repository on sourceforge which
has also been incorporated into the GIT repository.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="changes">
<h1>Changes</h1>
<p>Version 0.8: Fix README.rst</p>
<p>Cleanup of README before releasing 0.8 on pypi.</p>
<p>Version 0.7: Update tests, Compatibility</p>
<p>Now a test for AGI exists (in addition the the existing AMI test).
Asterisk in newer versions yields output of AMI commands prefixed with
<tt class="docutils literal">Output:</tt>. This was already correctly parsed into the <tt class="docutils literal">multiheaders</tt>
variable where Lines with a repeated header are kept. For
backwards-compatibility all these lines are also put into the old
<tt class="docutils literal">data</tt> variable, too. So if you were using <tt class="docutils literal">data</tt> with old versions
of asterisk your code continues to work with pyst.
Python 3.7 has introduced a new keyword <tt class="docutils literal">async</tt>. Unfortunately we were
using this keyword as a parameter of the AMI <tt class="docutils literal">originate</tt> call. I've
changed this to <tt class="docutils literal">run_async</tt> (to be compatible with pyst2, I would have
named it simpy <tt class="docutils literal">asynchronous</tt>, see the commit history).</p>
<p>Version 0.6: Minor feature enhancements</p>
<p>The asterisk management interface emulator asterisk/astemu now can be
used for unit-tests of applications using asterisk.manager. We're using
this in the regression test (see test directory). But this way it is
usable by others.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Factor asterisk emulator from regression test into own module</li>
</ul>
<p>Version 0.5: Small install change</p>
<p>Fix setup.py to include download_url. This makes it installable using
intall tools like pip.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Add download_url to setup.py</li>
<li>Fix svn url after SourceForge upgrade</li>
</ul>
<p>Version 0.4: Minor feature enhancements</p>
<p>Small feature extensions to AGI and Manager modules. Add a regression
test which now covers some aspects of the manager API.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Handle events with several fields with the same name (e.g. 'Variable'
in the 'AgentCalled' event. Thanks to Max Nesterov for the
suggestion, implementation differs from the suggestion in SF patch
3290869. For a use-case see the give SF patch and the regression test
case test_agent_event.</li>
<li>Allow to use AGI module in FastAGI way via TCP connection.
This change allows you to specify the socket streams instead
sys.stdin/sys.stdout streams. Thanks to Max Nesterov for the patch.
Applies SF patch 3047290.</li>
<li>Add regression test framework and some test cases for manager API.</li>
<li>The generated ActionID for the manager interface now includes the
process-ID, this allows several concurrent processes using the
manager API.</li>
</ul>
<p>Version 0.3: Minor feature enhancements</p>
<p>New maintainer Ralf Schlatterbeck, this is my first release, please
report any problems via the Sourceforge Bug-Tracker or email me
directly. Thanks to Karl Putland for writing the original package.
Thanks to Matthew Nicholson for maintaining the package for some years
and for handing over maintenance when he was no longer interested.
The parsing of answers from asterisk was completely rewritten. This
should fix problems people were having with commands returning embedded
'/' or empty lines. Some new manager commands added.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Add playdtmf manager command</li>
<li>add sippeers and sipshowpeer manager commands</li>
<li>rewritten manager communication</li>
<li>should no longer choke on '/' in answers returned from a manager
command (fixes SF Bug 2947866)</li>
<li>should now correctly parse multi-line output with embedded empty
lines, e.g. <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">mgr.command('dialplan</span> show')</tt></li>
<li>Bug-fix for list manipulation in <tt class="docutils literal">event_dispatch</tt>, thanks to Jan
Mueller, see mailinglist comment from 2008-04-18</li>
<li>Merge unreleased changes from repository of Matthew Nicholson
in particular a typo in <tt class="docutils literal">agi.py</tt> for <tt class="docutils literal">set_autohangup</tt>, and change
of <tt class="docutils literal">get_header</tt> methods (see Upgrading instructions). The fixed
<tt class="docutils literal">manager.command</tt> support is already in (with a different
solution). The unreleased changes are also on the 0.2 branch in the
subversion repository in case somebody is interested.</li>
