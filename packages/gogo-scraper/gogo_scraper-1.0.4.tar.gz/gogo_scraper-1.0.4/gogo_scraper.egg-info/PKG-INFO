        <br />
        <br />
        
        ```import gogo_scraper as gogo  # import module```
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        
        <p> Gets list of Gogoanime search results for the query "naruto" </p>
        
        ```search = gogo.search("naruto")```
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        
        <p> Get link to naruto episode 10</p>
        <p> Here, "naruto" is the exact anime title/link in Gogoanime. Other anime might have complicated titles, so first use gogo.search() to get exact title</p>
        
        ```link = gogo.getEpisode("naruto", 10)```
        
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        
        <p> Get latest episode from naruto </p>
        <p> Returns a dictionary {ep_num: 220, link: ...} </p>
        
        ```latest_episode = gogo.getLatestEpisode("naruto")```
        
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        
        All these functions also take an optional `base_url` parameter, which could be used to scrap from a different Gogoanime server.
        
        Users could also directly change `gogo.BASE_URL` to globally change the server being used
