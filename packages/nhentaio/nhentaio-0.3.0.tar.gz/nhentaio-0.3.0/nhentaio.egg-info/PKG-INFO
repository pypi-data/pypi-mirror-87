Description: # Nhentaio
        An asynchronous, read-only nhentai API wrapper for the damned, depraved, and disillusioned.
        
        ## But why?
        You can blame @AbstractUmbra for this one. This is entirely his fault. I had absolutely nothing to do with it.
        
        ## Installation
        To install from PyPi:
        
        ```sh
        # Adjust based on your environment - you may want "py" instead of "python3" on windows
        python3 -m pip install nhentaio
        ```
        
        
        If you do not value your safety - nor your sanity - you can install directly from the master branch.
        ```sh
        # Adjust based on your environment - you may want "py" instead of "python3" on windows
        python3 -m pip install git+https://github.com/kaylynn234/nhentaio
        ```
        
        If you're managing your project with Poetry, you can use the following:
        ```sh
        poetry add nhentaio
        ```
        
        Do note that nhentaio requires recent-ish versions of `aiohttp`, `python-dateutil` and `lxml` to be installed. More information can be found in `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml`. Using Poetry has the advantage of managing venvs and dependencies for you.
        
        Nhentaio requires Python 3.7 or later.
        
        
        ## Quickstart
        Here's a quick example to get you going.
        ```py
        client = nhentaio.Client()
        
        # Put a 6 digit ID of your choice here - I'm not giving you any ideas.
        gallery = await client.fetch_gallery(...)
        
        for page in gallery.pages:
            await page.save(f"{gallery.name}_{page.number}.png")
        ```
        
        ## Documentation
        Documentation can be found at <https://nhentaio.readthedocs.io/>.
        
        ## What do you mean "API"?
        Nhentai technically doesn't have a public front-facing API for other services to use.
        As such, getting results out of nhentai requires a more barbaric approach: web scraping.
        This library employs heavy use of the Xpath specification for that purpose.
        As long as nhentai doesn't change anything too drastically - which they tend not to do - this library should keep working.
        If for some reason it does break, or the behavior you receive is unexpected, please open an issue or a PR.
