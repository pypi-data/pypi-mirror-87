# HammerTime

HammerTime is an HTTP client library aiming to perform a large number of requests
on a server as fast as it can take them, but without distrupting operations
significantly. The primary focus of the library is to support the development of
pentest tools. As such, a set of heuristics are provided to rapidly discard some
requests, filter out invalid responses and generally augment the data available.
