Description: # Imgrender: Python Terminal Image Viewer
        
        Terminal image viewer in python, inspired by https://github.com/stefanhaustein/TerminalImageViewer. A piece of software designed to render
        images on the linux/bash command line. It can either be used as a CLI or as a python library. It should work on most modern terminals, including mobaxterm for windows and jupyter notebooks.
        
        ## Installation
        
        to Install imgrender, run `pip install imgrender`
        
        
        ## Usage
        
        ### Command Line
        
        
        ```
        usage: imgrender [-h] [--width WIDTH] [--height HEIGHT] path
        
        Render images on the command line
        
        positional arguments:
          path             the image path
        
        optional arguments:
          -h, --help       show this help message and exit
          --width WIDTH    width of the rendered image (default 60 pixels)
          --height HEIGHT  height of the rendered image (default 60 pixels)
        ```
        
        ### Python Library
        
        Simply import the render function from the imgrender library. The function has two arguments, the image path (positional), and the scale parameteter (keyword), which takes a tuple with two integer (height, width)
        
        for instance:
        
        ```
        In [1]: from imgrender import render
        
        In [2]: render('frog.jpg', scale=(40, 60))
        (this will render the image stored in 'frog.jpg' with 40x60 pixels)
        ```
        
        The render function can be called without passing in a scale argument, this will use the default scale parameters of (60, 60)
        
        
        ## Results
        
        below is an image of the city of Portsmouth generated as a 60x60 visualization.
