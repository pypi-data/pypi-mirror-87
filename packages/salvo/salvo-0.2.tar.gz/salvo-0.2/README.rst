This is the replacement for https://github.com/tarekziade/boom

**Salvo** is a simple command line tool to send some load to an HTTP(S)
endpoint.

Salvo is a script you can use to quickly smoke-test your
web app deployment. If you need a more complex tool,
I'd suggest looking at `Molotov <http://molotov.readthedocs.io>`_

Salvo was specifically written to replace my Apache Bench (ab) usage.
Salvo is based on Molotov, which uses Python 3 asyncio & aiohttp.


Installation
============

Salvo requires Python 3.6+ and **Molotov**, which gets installed as a
dependency.
