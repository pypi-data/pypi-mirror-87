# birthchartSVG

Birthchart SVG is a chart generator based on Kerykeion and Opeanstro.
Like the titles says it prints out SVG file of the birthchart,
it's very easy to use.

```python
# Install:
>>> pip3 install birthchartSVG

#Import:
>>> import birthchartSVG as br

# Make the instance:
>>> kanye = br.MakeInstance("Kanye", 1977, 6, 8, 8, 45, "Atlanta")

# Set the output directory for the SVG:
>>> kanye.set_dir = "/Users/{YourName}"

#Generate the SVG:
>>> kanye.makeSVG()


SVG generated successfully!

```
