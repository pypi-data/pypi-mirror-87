This is the distribution for OASYS of:

Biblioteca Auxiliar do Rafael Celestre for X-ray Refractive Optics.

This library allows to simulate compound refractive lenses under the projection approximation, valid for the conditions imposed by the paraxial approximation in the physical optics framework.
