Grid2Viz provides 2 agents with a scenario for one day and for one month available in `/grid2viz/data/agents` folder:

- do-nothing-baseline
- greedy-baseline

By default the config.ini is targeting these agents as well as the environment configuration folders.

To launch this demo, just Run gri2viz with no arguments:
