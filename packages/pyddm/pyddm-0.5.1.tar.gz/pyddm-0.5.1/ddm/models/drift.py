          particle positions) at which drift should be calculated

        included as an argument, but this convention allows PyDDM to
        automatically select the best simulation methods for the

        is a scalar, or an NDArray of the same size as `x` if `x` is
        an NDArray.  If the function does not depend on `x`, it should
