Description: # polybar-onlinestatus
        polybar module that checks if you are online
        
        To install use `pip install polybar-onlinestatus`
        
        And use module below:
        
        ```
        [module/onlinestatus]
        type = custom/script
        exec = polybar-onlinestatus
        tail = true
        label = %{T4} %output% %{T-}
        format-underline = #07BDEE
        ```
        
        ```font-3 = Hack Nerd Font:style=Bold:size=12```
        
        You can use any font you want, but make sure icon is big enough. I recommend Nerd Hack but it's up to you.
        
        For more options use ```polybar-onlinestatus --help``` in your terminal and assign options in ```exec = polybar-onlinestatus``` line.
        
        Icon used by default is `ï›¦`, if you are unable to see it - you need to install nerd font from nerdfonts.com
